KAR (Kids Artistic Review) is dedicated to recognising and encouraging dancers across the country and thousands participate on their stages. They acknowledge the achievements and excellence of teachers, choreographers, and parents. It was originally America's National Dance Competition – now also in Australia.

AUSA congratulates all members of Yevshan and especially the instructors and choreographers – Yaroslava King, Aliona King, and Victor Bovkun – who prepared the dance groups for the competition. AUSA asks the Ukrainian community to support them by attending the fund-raising events that will be organised in 2017 to help in off-setting the costs of sending these young dancers to attend the New York City Dance Experience.
