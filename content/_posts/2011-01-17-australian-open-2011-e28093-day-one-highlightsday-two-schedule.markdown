**AUSTRALIAN OPEN 2011 –
****DAY ONE HIGHLIGHTS/DAY TWO SCHEDULE**




 “DAY ONE SUCCESS – Stakhovsky through to ROUND 2.”


 As we approach the end of Day 1, Ukraine already has one through to the second round, with Sergiy Stakhovsky breezing through in straight sets against German, Daniel Brands.

Stakhovsky must now face neighbouring Polish competitor, Lukasz Kubot, for round 2. Kubot’s victory over the 18th seeded American, Sam Querrey, indicates that he is in form, so Stakhovsky will need all the support he can get. Expected to play on Wednesday, we encourage you all to make it down to support the Serge!

 Tomorrow, DAY TWO, hopes to be a great day for Ukrainian supporters as well, with the 4 remaining Ukrainian qualifiers competing! Please see the schedule below for more info.

 Once again, for any additional info, visit [www.ozeukes.com](http://www.ozeukes.com/) or [www.australianopen.com](http://www.australianopen.com/) 

With ground passes at $29 per day and $20 after 5pm, gather your friends and family and get down to Melbourne Park!

See you on the court!
Yours in Sport,
