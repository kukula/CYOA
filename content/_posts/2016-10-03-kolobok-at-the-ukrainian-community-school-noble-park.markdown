This show is inspired by the folktale Kolobok, the Ukrainian version of The Gingerbread Man. Kolobok is a little round freshly baked bun that escapes from an elderly couple and goes to the forest. Enter our wonderland of ordinary materials, animated characters and the magic of light that will make small things tall as a tree or round things huge as a planet!
