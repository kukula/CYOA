#### Ukrainian community to hold Flash Mob Rally at
Russian Embassy Canberra demanding the release of
Nadiya Savchenko
#FreeSavchenko


The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) will coordinate a small **Flash Mob Rally outside the Russian Embassy in Canberra –Wednesday March 9, 2016 at 10.45am **   to demand the release of former Ukrainian Air Force pilot, Nadiya Savchenko

The AFUO Chairman Stefan Romaniw will also endeavour to hand the Russian Ambassador Mr Vladimir Moroz or his staff a protest letter demanding:



 	  * Savchenko’ s release
 	  * Removal of all Russian forces from Ukraine territory
 	  * Halting Russian Federation support of militant separatists on Ukraine’ soil
 	  * Return of Crimea to Ukraine

Savchenko, a 34-year-old Member of Ukrainian Parliament and delegate to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in absentia, has been awaiting trial since being kidnapped and transported to Russia in 2014 by pro-Russian rebels. She was charged with the deaths of two Russian journalists whilst serving with a voluntary battalion in east Ukraine.

AFUO Chairman, Stefan Romaniw said “The prosecution by Russian authorities of Nadiya Savchenko is in clear violation of international law and clause 5 of the _Minsk Protocol_ of 5 September 2014. We call upon the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs to demand her release.”

Ukrainian diaspora the world over have been lobbying their governments for the past 18 months to demand her release. Australian Ukrainians will gather on 9 March as part of an international campaign, including a social media storm, to raise awareness for Savchenko’ s imprisonment.

The AFUO has called on



 	  * Prime Minister Turnbull to express Australia’s support for Savchenko’s release
 	  * The Minister or Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop to formally protest to the Ambassador of the Russian Federation on Savchenko’ s imprisonment
 	  * The Federal Opposition to express support for Savchenko
 	  * Other Members of Parliament to show solidarity especially the Australian Ukraine Parliamentary Friendship Group Chaired by Craig Laundy MP
 	  * Amnesty International, Australian Women Pilots Association and the National Council of Women of Australia to support the Campaign for her release

Savchenko was denied a closing statement on her final day in court for what her lawyers have described as a show trial. She has vowed a second hunger strike, the first of which lasted for 83 days.
