**Chris Crewther MP Member for Dunkley** has agreed to accept the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisation's  (AFUO) proposal to Chair the Australia - Ukraine Parliamentary Friendship Group (AUPFG).

**Senator Catryna Bilyk (Tasmania**) had also agreed to stay on as deputy chair.

Both are very strong supporters of Ukraine and Australia's Ukrainian community.

AFUO Chairman Stefan Romaniw and Dunkley electorate resident Chrestyna Kmetj (who has worked Mr. Crewther in the past) met with Mr. Crewther today at his electoral office to discuss his involvement as Chair of the Group.

They presented him with an overview of Australia’s Ukrainian community, its proactive work and its links with Ukraine.

The AFUO also has a relationship with the Ukraine-Australia Parliamentary Friendship Group and will work to bring both groups together.

The AFUO proposed possible areas of activity for the AUPFG:



 	  * Offer stronger support for Ukraine against Russian aggression,
 	  * Combatting Russian propaganda
 	  * Building stronger bilateral relations,
 	  * Business development
 	  * Support for PM Turnbull to visit Ukraine
 	  * Delegation of MP’s to visit Ukraine in 2018
 	  * Representation to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Foreign , Affairs and Trade to increase support for Ukraine and strengthen sanctions
 	  * Formation of a ‘fluid’ working relationship between the Parliamentary Friendship Groups of the Commonwealth – UK, Canada, Australia

Mr. Romaniw also had telephone conversation today with Senator Bilyk, who expressed her delight in continuing to assist in leading the Group.

Earlier this week the AFUO discussed the proposal for this leadership team with the Office of the Prime Minister, leadership of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Leader of the Opposition The Hon Bill Shorten.

Both Mr. Crewther and Senator Bilyk, will approach colleagues to join the Group.

**CALL TO ACTION**

The AFUO calls on AFUO  Member Organisations nationally together with members of the community to contact Federal Members of Parliament who have an interest in Ukraine or have a working relationship with the community and encourage them to join.

Please provide the AFUO with their names.

Upon formalizing all the requirements the AUPFG and AFUO will host an event at Parliament House to launch the Group.

The matter will be raised in a meeting with the Leader of the State Opposition The Hon Matthew Guy next week and for work to commence shortly after.
