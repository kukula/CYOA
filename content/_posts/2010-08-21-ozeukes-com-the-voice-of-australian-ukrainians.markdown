The launch of the new ‘refreshed’ ozeukes website during this year’s national Ukrainian Independence Day celebrations sets the foundation of what the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisation (AFUO) believes will be the ‘voice of Australian Ukrainians’.


Firstly, I would like to take this opportunity to thank those who have assisted me in its development and they include - Warren & Helena Denley, Steve & Olya Lutrov, Anna Kaminskyj, Stephan Potashnyk, Natalia Tkaczuk, and Greg Lubczenko. Also, I am grateful to the contribution and support of my fellow AFUO directors and community members who have so far provided content; for this is what will ensure the websites success in the future.

The main objective of redeveloping the new website was to create an unique, interactive and engaging portal that will serve  as a communications tool  for the Australian Ukrainian community. While our backgrounds and experiences are diverse, there is a common bond, we have a Ukrainian connection.  ozeukes.com ‘the voice of Australian Ukrainians’ will strive to create a virtual online community bringing together mutual interests of Ukrainians across Australia.

Our goal ultimately is for ozeukes.com to cross geographical boundaries and reach Ukraine and  the Ukrainian Diaspora, (the USA, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, the United Kingdom, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, France, Belgium, Romania, and the former Yugoslavia) to provide our visitors with an interactive experience and platform to interact with Ukrainians in Australia.  I note that the site is still in its youth and our strategic direction and long term vision will be to embrace all things Ukrainian Australian streamed under one portal.

The AFUO will continually strive to add more information regularly to update you with the latest happenings locally, internationally and from Ukraine and look forward to your contributions, blogs and comments through the site.

I am positive that our website will spark some excitement in our community and invite you to frequently visit ozeukes.com.
