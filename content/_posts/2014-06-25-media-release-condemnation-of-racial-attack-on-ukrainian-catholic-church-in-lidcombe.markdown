## CONDEMNATION OF RACIAL ATTACK ON UKRAINIAN CATHOLIC CHURCH IN LIDCOMBE


The racially motivated vandalism and desecration of St. Andrew’s Ukrainian Catholic Church in Lidcombe was jointly condemned today by the Federal Member for Reid, Craig Laundy MP, and the State Member for Auburn, the Hon. Barbara Perry MP.

“I am appalled by this abhorrent attack on a religious site and the distress it has caused the parishioners and our community as a whole,” Mr. Laundy said

“Although the perpetrators of this crime were intending to vilify and intimidate the Ukrainian- Australian community, quite the opposite has occurred."

“This morning, in a show of support for the Ukrainian-Australian community, I was delighted to join Mrs. Perry, Father Simon Ckuj, the parish priest, and members of the public in cleaning off the graffiti from the church walls.

“Hate speech has no place in our inclusive and multicultural society, and I urge anyone who has any information relating to this crime to contact the NSW Police immediately.”

Mrs. Perry said: “I join with Mr Laundy in condemning the disgusting attack on a sacred place and on the reputation and integrity of the Australian-Ukrainian community.

“This is a shocking and disturbing act and one which has caused distress for our community and the parishioners of St. Andrew. I acknowledge and support Father Simon who called for forgiveness and unity in Sunday’s sermon.

“The great strength of our country is that people do not react to global issues and when this happens it needs to be found out and those responsible punished by the justice system.
“This is not just a crime against the Ukrainian Catholic Church and its members, it is a crime against our way of life.


### AFUO WELCOMES RUSSIAN AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY’S SUPPORT


The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) welcomes the Russian Australian community’s condemnation of the recent hate crime at St Andrew’s Ukrainian Catholic Church in western Sydney.

AFUO President Stefan Romaniw OAM (who is also former Chair of the Victorian Multicultural Commission; Executive Director of Community Languages Australia, and: an Australia Day Ambassador) said:

“We thank the Russian Australian community for its support in the face of this abhorrent and unAustralian act. Both our communities have made strong positive contributions to Australia, even as ANZACs, and know that what is most important is our democratic and multicultural fabric here in Australia and always working to uphold it.

“Based on at least 65 years of peaceful relations as neighbours, schoolmates, workmates and friends, I am confident that both our communities will never allow some unknown person or persons, currently being investigated by the NSW Police for a hate crime against Ukrainian Australians, sway us from the course of community harmony in Australia.

“Russian Australians and Ukrainian Australians will not be provoked into a false conflict because we know that what’s most important is that we are all Australians first and foremost.

“The Ukrainian Australian community also strongly thanks our elected representatives, other ethnic community leaders and members of the general public who have greatly comforted us with their solidarity in this stressful time. We are very grateful to have your friendship and support,” Mr. Romaniw said.
The following is a translation from the recent issue of Sydney-based Russian language newspaper “Unification”:


<blockquote>The Russian community condemns the provocative act contrary to the policy of multicultural Australia. The authors’ graffiti was clearly trying to bring about tension and incite enmity between friendly communities. At a meeting of Ukrainian and Russian communities in March with the CRC (Community Relations Commission for a multicultural NSW), agreement was reached not to transfer the conflict that happens in Ukraine to Australia. The Russian community supports peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine, taking into account the interests of all ethnic groups living in the country.</blockquote>
