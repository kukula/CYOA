](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Canberra-rally-thumb.jpg)Scores of cars from Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney carrying Ukrainian flags drove to Canberra to take part in an AutoMaidan round the streets of Australia’s capital city on Sunday May 25th 2014, the day of Presidential elections in Ukraine.  The AutoMaidan terminated in front of the Russian embassy where hundreds of peaceful protesters expressed their support for Ukraine and strong opposition to Putin’s aggression in Ukraine.

Earlier in the day many of the protesters who had Ukrainian citizenship had taken the opportunity to vote at the Ukrainian Embassy.
