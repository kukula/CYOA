](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AUWA-Logo-thumb.jpg)Western Australians of all backgrounds will send a loud and strong message to Putin that his military invasion of Ukraine is unacceptable and illegal, and that the world will act against him in defense of Ukraine's democracy and independence.
It's up to us to make the difference. Join with us:


**When: Sunday, March 9 from 1:30pm**
**Where: Wesley Church (cnr of Hay and William Sts) Perth**


Wear Ukrainian shirts, blouses, your favourite Ukrainian T-shirt.  Bring Australian and Ukrainian flags, signs/banners condemning Putin's actions and calling for international solution.
