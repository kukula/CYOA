](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Tennis.png)Congratulations to Alexander Dolgopolov, the unseeded Ukrainian tennis player who today defeated the fourth-seeded Swede Robin Soderling in five sets 1-6 6-3 6-1 4-6 6-2 at the Australian Tennis Open.

Despite badly losing the first set, Alexander quietly and competently rallied to outsmart and out-play his larger and more-experienced opponent.  The further the match progressed, the more positively did Alexander play, winning over the support of the vocal crowd.
Alexander will next face Andy Murray in the quarter-finals.
