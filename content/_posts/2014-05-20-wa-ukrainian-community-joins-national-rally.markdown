CYM (Ukrainian Youth Association of WA) and the Ukrainian Association of Western Australia (UAWA) calls on all concerned Australians to attend the FAIR ELECTIONS mean A FREE UKRAINE - PERTH RALLY  

The rally will voice its strong opposition to Putin’s aggression in South East Ukraine (namely Sloviansk, Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol, Odessa, and many other cities where the "green men" have stepped in and made fear and death a reality in Ukraine!!)

It will be held in front of the Wesley Church cnr of William Street and Hay Street in Perth WA on Sunday May 25, 2014 from 1.00pm - the day of the Presidential elections in Ukraine.

The UAWA calls on Western Australian membership and members of the Ukrainian community and broader Australian community to attend this rally.
