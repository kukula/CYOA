As you may be aware our guests from Ukraine, Folknery - Voloymyr Muliar and Iryna Havrylets are now the proud parents of a newly arrived son Marko.

Marko was born last week 2 months premature in Royal Women’s Hospital in Sydney and will need to spend up to two months in hospital.

Iryna and Volodymyr had tickets booked to Argentina on May 2, 2016, but the unexpected birth of their son will now see them have to stay in Australia for longer period. The AFUO is assisting with migration advice via a Migration Agent. We are in daily contact with them.

Given the unexpected course of nature the hospital charges will be high.

As numerous people and organisations have approached the AFUO and offered assistance the AFUO encourages any Parish , person or organisation wishing to provide financial assistance to do so. In consultation with Volodymyr, you can use their account to make a contribution.

Folknery are very thankful for everyone’s well wishes and support.
