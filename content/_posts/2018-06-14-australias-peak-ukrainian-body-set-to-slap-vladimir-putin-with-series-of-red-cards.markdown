For the duration of the 2018 football World Cup hosted by the Russian Federation, the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) will participate in the worldwide #RedCard4Putin campaign.

An initiative of the [International Coalition for Human Rights](http://www.ichumanrights.org) (ICHR) the campaign will systematically issue red cards to Vladimir Putin’s regime calling out the host country’s crimes and violations of international law. Each red card will be publicised through social and traditional media, news releases, and civic activism.

The campaign’s objective is to highlight Russia’s human rights atrocities, annexation of Crimea and invasion of Eastern Ukraine, western election meddling and disinformation while the country hosts the high profile event.

AFUO Chair Stefan Romaniw said “We’re pleased the Australian Government has declared a diplomatic boycott by confirming no official Australian delegation will attend the World Cup in Russia. But it’s not enough.”

“The behaviour and values of the Russian Federation are in complete opposition to the spirit of the World Cup and people should not be blindsided by Vladimir Putin playing the charming host.” Mr Romaniw said.

The ICHR is a coalition of non-government organisations and individuals committed to supporting and advocating for human rights around the world. The #RedCard4Putin campaign will run for the duration of the World Cup event from 14 June – 15 July 2018.

In its guide for host countries bidding for the 2026 World Cup, FIFA states “The FIFA World Cup is becoming more global. It will catch the eyes of the world like never before. Our duty is
to ensure that these eyes look in the right direction; towards indisputably deserving hosts.”

Let’s hope FIFA takes this duty more seriously when selecting the next World Cup host country.
