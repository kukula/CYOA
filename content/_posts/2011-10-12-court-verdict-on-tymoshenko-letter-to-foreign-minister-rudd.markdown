Dear Minister,

The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) draws your attention to the verdict handed down this evening, Tuesday October 11, 2011, (Australian Time) by the Pechersky Court in Kyiv in the trial against former Prime Minister of Ukraine, Yulia Tymoshenko.

The court sentenced Tymoshenko to seven years' incarceration and a 3 year ban from holding public office. She now has 15 days to appeal.

Tymoshenko was sentenced for alleged abuse of power in her dealings in signing the Gas deal with the Russian Federation during her term of office.

The AFUO wrote to you at the time of her detention highlighting the very political nature of this court action. At the time the response from your Office  was as follows;

_"The Government is deeply concerned about the arrest. It raises doubts about motives in the trial proceedings and contributes to the appearance of a politically-motivated prosecution.  We will continue to encourage Ukrainian authorities to give consideration to Ms Tymoshenko’s immediate release, and ensure that her trial meets international standards of transparency and fairness_."

Over the past weeks many European leaders have condemned the trial, highlighting its political nature and attempt to eliminate Tymoshenko as an Opposition leader.

During the same period Ukraine's aspirations for associate membership in the European Union have been hampered due to the fact that many European leaders indicated that Ukraine must adhere to European democratic practices and that _show  trials_ were in contradictions with these standards.




The AFUO calls on the Australian Government to express its concern and dismay as to the process and final verdict in this case.




It is important to demand the adherence to democratic processes and that actions of this nature against political rivals are totally unacceptable.

No doubt there will be outrage and action from many countries in sending President Yanukovych a clear message that this situation will lead to ramifications.

We ask that you join with other world leaders and Ministers of Foreign Affairs in a sending a strong and unequivocal message of protest  to President Yanukovych and his Government.

Yours sincerely
