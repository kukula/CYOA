** THIS IS ONCE AGAIN A MASS CALL OUT TO ALL UKRAINIAN SUPPORTERS TO COME DOWN TO MELBOURNE PARK TOMORROW, 26th January, 2011 AND SUPPORT ONE OF OUR OWN!**


** 

**



Dolgopolov will need all the support he can get to make it through to the semis, so pack your picnic lunch and make a great day of it.




As the 3rd day match on Rod Laver arena, it is expected that the match won't start till after 2pm.


Whether it be a $29 ground pass or an actual $129 ticket into the arena, come down wearing you yellow and blue and support our the last Ukrainian left in the competition!
