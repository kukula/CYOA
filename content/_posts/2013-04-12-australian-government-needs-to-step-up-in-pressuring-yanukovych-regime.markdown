AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO STEP UP




IN PRESSURING YANUKOVYCH REGIME


The release from inappropriate incarceration of Ukraine’s former Interior Minister and former Environment Minister by the Yanukovych regime shows international pressure for continued democratization in Ukraine can be effective and that Australia needs to step up.

“Respect for the rule of law and human rights – as demonstrated by the release of Yuriy Lutsenko and Heorhiy Filipchuk - is a positive step on the path to Ukraine’s greater Euro-integration,” Mr. Stefan Romaniw, Chairman of the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations, said

“Important next steps are the release of former President Yulia Tymoshenko, who has been incarcerated without basis for nearly 20 months, and the signing of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement during the Third Summit of the Eastern Partnership in Vilnius in late November.

“It is no coincidence that the release came days after the former US Ambassador to Ukraine called for the use of personal financial sanctions against regime figures if human rights are not protected.

“The international community has made a difference and can continue to do so. The Australian Government needs to add its voice to those calling for greater democratization and respect for human rights by the Yanukovych regime.

“We call again on the Minister for Foreign Affairs Bob Carr to appeal to President Yanukovych to release Ms. Tymoshenko and support the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement or be subject to the provisions of the _Magnitsky Bill_.

“Working for greater human rights and democracy in Ukraine aligns with Australia’s long-term commitments. Moreover, a liberalized Ukraine represents greater trade and economic opportunity for Australia. It’s therefore time for Bob Carr to act,” Mr. Romaniw said.

The Ukrainian World Congress (UWC) representing 20 million Ukrainians in the diaspora has repeatedly called on the Yanukovych regime to act and reverse unlawful decisions which are hindering Ukraine's Euro-integration process.
