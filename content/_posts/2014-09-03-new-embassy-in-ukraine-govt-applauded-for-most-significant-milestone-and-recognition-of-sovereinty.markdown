## NEW EMBASSY IN UKRAINE: GOV’T APPLAUDED FOR MOST SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE & RECOGNITION OF SOVEREIGNTY


The Ukrainian Australian community strongly applauds the announcement by the Abbott Government of the opening of an Australian Embassy in Kyiv in Ukraine.
The community was joined in welcoming the very significant development by Mr Craig Laundy MP, Chair of the Australia/Ukraine Parliamentary Friendship Group.
Mr Stefan Romaniw OAM, President of the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO), said from Kyiv where he is currently participating in high-level meetings with Ukrainian Government officials: “Prime Minister Abbott’s announcement of an Embassy in Ukraine is the most significant positive milestone in the Australia-Ukraine relationship. It strongly recognises Ukraine’s independence, democracy and territorial sovereignty, and helps secure it’s future in the face of Mr Putin’s aggressive invasion.
“Our community strongly acknowledges the Government for its continued leadership position on Ukraine through this move, as well as its lobbying of G20 members to ban Mr Putin from coming to G20 in Australia,” Mr Romaniw said.
Mr Laundy said: “I warmly welcome the announcement of the Prime Minister today. This is a facility that the local Australian/Ukrainian community has been seeking for many years and I am delighted to be a part of a government that has delivered this important symbol of the unity that exists between Australia and Ukraine.”
Mr Romaniw continued: “While the Australia-Ukraine relationship has rapidly developed due to a tragedy and a crisis, it’s future is very positive and promising. There are strong trade-related opportunities for both countries, including in resources, mining services, and food, including cattle, and these will be well pursued by a permanent Embassy.
“We also strongly welcome humanitarian aid and military logistics for Ukraine by Australia as noted by the Prime Minister. Casualties and impacts from Mr Putin’s invasion are regretfully growing.
“The AFUO thanks the Government, particularly the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister, as well as many others who have contributed, such as our current excellent Ambassador Jean Dunn, and Members of Parliament such as Craig Laundy, Philip Ruddock, Catrina Bilyk and Laurie Ferguson,” Mr Romaniw concluded.
