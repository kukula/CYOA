** **AUSTRALIA'S UKRAINIAN COMMUNITY CALLS ON AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION TO SUPPORT UKRAINE'S SPEEDY EURO-INTERGRATION






The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO)  has written to the Minister for Foreign Affairs Bob Carr calling on Australia to support Ukraine’s integration into Europe.

A similar letter sent to Opposition Foreign Affairs  spokesperson Julie Bishop called for the Opposition to support this position  and also to monitor the Australian Government activity in ensuring it acts  quickly on this matter.

The AFUO has also written to leaders of the European Union (EU) supporting the international action initiated  by the Ukrainian World Congress (UWC) calling on communities around the world to raise awareness of the need to support Ukraine's integration in Europe, if Ukraine is to pulled out of its current unstable and uncertain political position.

The UWC supported by the AFUO, in its approach to the EU believes by signing the _EU-Ukraine Association Agreement_, the EU would be taking an important step in that direction and in  furthering the modernization and Europeanization of Ukraine, the sixth most populous country, and the largest by area, in Europe. It would be a very positive decision with tremendous future benefits for the EU and Ukraine.

"In supporting this position Australia will have contributed to the stabilisation and strengthening of the international community", Stefan Romaniw   AFUO Chairman said today.

"In his recent message to the Ukrainian community Minister Carr stated that  ... _we share a commitment to international peace and security..._  The AFUO sees Australia's support at all levels for Ukraine's Euro integration as an opportunity to make this commitment a living element of Australia's foreign policy," Mr Romaniw said.

"Australia's  decision should be made not on the basis of the current governing authorities  but rather, according to the long-term best interests of Europe, Ukraine and regional security, stability and prosperity and the potential Ukraine brings and the ongoing opportunities for Australia" Mr Romaniw said.

The UWC coordinates international  activity and has contact with the Ukrainian Diaspora in 47 countries around the globe.
