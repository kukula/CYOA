## A celebration of migration




### Port Melbourne




### Free event


Multicultural Arts Victoria has organised the second Piers Festival, a massive celebration of cultural diversity that reflects the rich history of Melbourne's ports precinct.  From the goldrush to wartime, from post-war migration to cruise shipping, Station & Princes Piers have played a pivotal role in Victoria's growth and offered a gateway to the diversity of cultures that enrich our community.

World music, dance, food, arts & crafts, photo & historical exhibitions, boat display, kid's activities and fireworks!
