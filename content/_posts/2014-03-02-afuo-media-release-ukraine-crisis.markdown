The Russian president Vladimir Putin has instigated a number of illegal, provocative and dangerous actions against Ukraine.  These include



	  * the military invasion and occupation of Crimea by several thousand Russian combat troops
	  * the violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity
	  * the breaking of a number of international treaties including the 1994 Budapest Memorandum and the bilateral agreement governing Russia's naval base in Sevastopol
	  * the massing of troops, military vehicles and aircraft on Ukraine’s borders
	  * the approval by the Russian parliament of Putin’s request to send troops into Ukraine
	  * the orchestration of pro-Russian demonstrations across southern and eastern Ukraine
	  * the gross misrepresentation of actual facts and recent events related to Ukraine
	  * failure to talk to the Ukrainian government

 A growing number of countries including the USA, EU and several of its member countries and Canada, have made forceful statements to the Russian president to withdraw his troops back to their bases and follow legal and diplomatic norms.  The United Nations Security Council is holding an open meeting on the growing crisis in Ukraine brought about by Russian aggression.  Some countries have stopped preparations for the upcoming G8 Summit in Sochi.

 The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) condemns the Russian military invasion of independent Ukraine, and calls on the Australian government to take the strongest measures in opposing the totally illegal and unprovoked aggression against Ukraine.  The following statement has been released:  [MEDIA RELEASE 'PUTIN GET OUT OF UKRAINE'](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MEDIA-RELEASE-PUTIN-GET-OUT-OF-UKRAINE.pdf)
