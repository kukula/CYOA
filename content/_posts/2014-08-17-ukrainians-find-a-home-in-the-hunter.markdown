TUESDAY, August 19, marks the 65th anniversary of the arrival of the Ukraine community in Newcastle.




On that day in 1949, a migrant vessel, the Fairsea, arrived at Lee Wharf.




The Fairsea was the first migrant ship to arrive in Newcastle after World War II and on board were 1842 passengers, most refugees or displaced people from many European countries, including the Ukraine, who came to seek a new life.




Among those were Peter and Maria Tarnawskyj, with their two small daughters Olga and Anna.
