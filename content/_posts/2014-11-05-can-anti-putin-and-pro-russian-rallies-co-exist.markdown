The Australian Federation of Ukranian Organisations have decided to use the arrival of Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold a broad-based anti-Putin rally, while a pro-Russian group calling itself RUstralia (or Russian Voice Downunder) have decided to stage a 'welcome' ceremony for the Russian delegation.

4ZZZ reporter Steven Riggall spoke to organisers of both groups: Chair of The Australian Federation of Ukranian Organisations **Stefan Romaniw** and RUstralia members **Ksenia Timbay** and **Matt Cranswick**.
