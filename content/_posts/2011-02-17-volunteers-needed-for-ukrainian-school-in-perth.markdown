](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/AUWA-Logo.jpg)The Ukrainian Ethnic School in Perth is looking for volunteers who can assist in teaching at the Ukrainian School

The position would suit someone who has either had teaching experience (or is a teacher) in Australia or Ukraine; however the most important qualification is to be able to communicate to young children.

Even if you are not a teacher but have good knowledge of Ukrainian and can communicate to young children we would like to hear from you.

The biggest reward is to help our youth obtain knowledge of spoken Ukrainian and cultural awareness ~ which is priceless!

If you can spare an hour a week of your time please contact
