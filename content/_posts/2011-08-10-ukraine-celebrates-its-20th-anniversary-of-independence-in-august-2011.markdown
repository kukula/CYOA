# **Ukraine celebrates its 20th Anniversary of Independence**




# **on 24th August 2011**




### The TIME IS RIGHT!!!








* * *






20 years on, it's a good time to reflect as Ukrainians and as members of the broader Australian community as to how we have contributed to the community, how we have maintained and shared our Ukrainian religious beliefs, our heritage and ancestry over the 60 years here in Australia and the last 20 years of Independence. 

**It's a time to ask -_What can I do now to maintain and/or share, or in some cases to reconnect to these Ukrainian religious beliefs, to our heritage and ancestry?_** 

In my home, with my peers, in my workplace, at my sports club, at my place of study - they are all places where I have a sphere of influence in promoting things Ukrainian. 

In Australia, our neighbours, work colleagues, friends, our school and university peers readily embrace diversity.  Give them the opportunity to experience Ukraine and things Ukrainian. 

Let's recommit in our own families, in our own hearts that having Ukrainian ancestry is something special.  It needs to be fed and nurtured. 

20 years is a fair amount of time.  If you are 40 now - you were 20, probably having a great time as a student, if you are 80 you were 60 and probably still working, if you are 25, you were starting school. 

A lot has happened.  The question to be asked is where you were 20 years ago in terms of your Ukrainian involvement and commitment and where are you now?  If you have let it slip – Reconnect.  If you have continued to be part of the community you have no doubt been a fine example for others.  The other question we need to ask - What will it be like in 20 years time?  Where will I be, where will we be, where will the community be? 

_Yes, it’s a good time to take stock, reflect on the past and look to the future!_ 

**On this occasion the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations calls on;**

**The** **President and Government **of Ukraine to do everything possible to ensure Ukraine takes up its rightful place among the nations of the world and ensure that free speech, academic freedom, political positioning and the Ukrainian language and history are not compromised. At present there are many contentious issues that need immediate addressing if Ukraine is to find it way.  

**The Australian Government **to do more in engaging with Ukraine. Today Ukraine needs the international community to ensure freedom of speech and press are upheld, business opportunities created and protected. The Australian Government should also consider strengthening diplomatic ties and consider the opening of a formal diplomatic post in Kyiv. 

Other opportunities for Government lie in many areas -  in the Arts by engaging with   Ukraine, bringing out to Australia cultural groups to perform  at major arts festivals, engaging with the fashion world and showcasing Ukrainian fashion at Australia's major fashion festivals. 

There are many opportunities for bilateral cooperation. 

 **To all ** 

It is a time to celebrate. The AFUO encourages you to celebrate with us. It's time to explore opportunities. We encourage you to do so. We encourage you to continue to maintain contact with the Ukrainian community or in some cases reconnect with your Ukrainian roots. 

  


### IT'S TIME!  Why not use this 20th anniversary to act?
