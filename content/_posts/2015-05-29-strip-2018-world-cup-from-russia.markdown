**STRIP 2018 WORLD CUP FROM RUSSIA **




The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) joins the international community calling on Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) to strip the Russian Federation of hosting the 2018 World Cup.


Hosting rights to the tournament were awarded by FIFA in December 2010 prior to the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and illegal occupation of the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine.

With a string of corruption charges facing several key FIFA administrators, AFUO President Stefan Romaniw is calling on the organisation for better governance and to reverse its decision to host its tournament in Russia:

“The question FIFA should be asking itself is ‘How can we let a country in clear violation of international law host our event which is a symbol of worldwide peace and unity?’

“For FIFA to continue its plans to host the 2018 World Cup in Russia would mean a direct endorsement of the Putin regime’s attack on Ukraine.  A renewed FIFA administration should immediately strip Russia’s privilege of hosting the 2018 World Cup.” Mr Romaniw said
