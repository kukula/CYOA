**_Opening its 2013 subscription series with trademark flare and virtuosity, Flinders Quartet proudly welcomes the winner of the 2012 Sydney International Piano Competition (SIPCA) ‘Flinders Quartet Prize’, Ukrainian pianist Dmitry Onishchenko, as their guest in a concert of Shostakovich, Ravel and Ian Munro. _**

Hand-picked by the quartet to tour with them in 2013, Dimitry also won the Australian Music Prize and the prize for Best Performance of a Debussy work at the Sydney International Piano Competition in 2012.

“When we selected Dimitry as the winner of the SIPCA ‘Flinders Quartet Prize’, we were attracted by his adventurous musical spirit, his interaction with other performers on stage and his obvious gift for connecting with the audience.  This performance is bound to excite and inspire both new audiences and loyal Flinders Quartet subscribers,” said Flinders Quartet cellist, Zoe Knighton.

“This is the first time that the quartet has performed with a guest international artist, and what better opportunity to programme the quintessentially Russian**Piano Quintet in G minor by Shostakovich** alongside an equally fabulous Australian work by **Ian Munro,**** ****_Divertissement sur le nom d’Erik Satie_** ­- a delightful, whimsical piano quintet which is close to our hearts,” she added.

The quartet will also perform **Ravel’s String Quartet in F major**.

Australian composer Ian Munro’s _Divertissement sur le nom d’Erik Satie_ is a series of eight brief movements following a day in the life of Eric Satie and was commissioned by Flinders Quartet in 2006.  Since its debut performance this work has steadily gained recognition and earned itself a place in the canon of contemporary repertoire for piano quintet.

Flinders Quartet violinist Helen Ayres, who performed Shostakovich’s Piano Trio No. 2 with Dmitry in the SIPCA 2012 Chamber Music round, described the experience of performing alongside him as ‘like having Shostakovich in the room’.

For Flinders Quartet 2013 is a season of new beginnings, welcoming Helen Ayres (violin) as a new permanent member of the ensemble and a series of guest violinists throughout the year: Shane Chen for this programme with Dimitry Onishchenko, and in later concerts, Shaun Lee-Chen and Cameron Hill.
