** Congratulations Goya Dmytryshchak on winning a Quill Award -**




**Another Proud Ukrainian**


 The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations  (AFUO) congratulates Goya Dmytryshchak on winning the Best Suburban Report in Print Quill for her stories on how methyl bromide, a chemical banned in many OECD countries, was being used in Altona, much to the concern of local residents. The story was later picked up by other news organizations.

Goya is of Ukrainian background and has over years been a very keen supporter of the community and written stories of particular community interest such as Chornobyl, Holodomor and other community events.

She has explored her Ukrainian roots which she cherishes.

"Winning a Quill is a great achievement and Ukrainians in Australia  are proud of Goya's efforts"  Stefan Romaniw Chairman of the AFUO said.

"We often speak of using our spheres of influence and Goya is one who does not shy away from a strong story. We wish he well in the future"  Mr. Romaniw said

Goya is a senior journalist with the Fairfax Community Network 

  

Judges Citation 


<blockquote>In a highly competitive field, the judges described Goya as the deserving winner for her report on the industrial use of methyl bromide to fumigate logs. Her investigation brought a company to account and prompted action by the chief health officer and the EPA. The judges said her report demonstrated community journalism at its best, giving residents a voice on what was arguably a life and death issue. </blockquote>
