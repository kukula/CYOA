Thanks to a new initiative from the [Dnister Ukrainian Credit Co-operative](https://www.dnister.com.au), you can make contributions to nominated community organisations, plus earn interest on your own savings, thanks to a [Community Saver Account. ](https://www.dnister.com.au/community-banking/?doing_wp_cron=1542447032.0516490936279296875000)

**How does it work? **

You create a Community Saver Account to use, and as according to Dnister's website:


<blockquote>

> 
> #### Not only will it provide you with a high interest savings account, Dnister will also annually contribute an additional 1.00%p.a¹ ‘beneficiary payment’ to your favourite nominated community organisation’s Community Access account.
> 
> 
</blockquote>


There are a number of community organisations who you can nominate. This includes the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations. To see a full list of potential beneficiaries, [go to Dnister's information page here](https://www.dnister.com.au/community-banking/?doing_wp_cron=1542447032.0516490936279296875000).

Organisations can apply to become beneficiaries, via creating a [Community Saving Account and applying](https://www.dnister.com.au/community-banking/?doing_wp_cron=1542447032.0516490936279296875000).
