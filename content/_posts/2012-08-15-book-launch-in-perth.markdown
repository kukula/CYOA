These are the Ukrainians who came by sea, hoping for safety and freedom_.

These poignant words are quoted from the prologue in Dr Lesa Melnyczuk’s most recent publication - **_Silent Memories, Traumatic Lives, Ukrainian Migrant Refugees in Western Australia_**.  This book was a result of Lesa’s doctoral research and was launched on Sunday, 12 August 2012 at the Western Australian Maritime Museum in Fremantle, a most befitting venue as this was where our Ukrainian immigrants first set foot on Western Australian soil.  The event was attended by some 200 persons, and those who were present took with them memories of a presentation that could not fail to create a lasting impression on heart and mind. The pouring rain outside somehow seemed to emphasize the magnitude of the subject matter.

The programme began with Mrs Annella Perzylo performing a soulful Ukrainian song – _Sitting by the Window_ - in her natural yet artful manner that brought the guests’ attention to the start of the event.
The MC, Diana Teplyj, firstly welcomed the dignitaries attending: Dr Dennis Jensen, MP member for Tangney, Ms Anu van Hattern, Honorary Consul for the Republic of Estonia, Mr Frank Crawley, Honorary Consul for Sri Lanka, and his wife, Susanne Crawley,  Mr Alec Coles, CEO of the WA Museum, Dr Nonja Peters, representative from the National Archives,  Mr Bill Massie, Councillor for the City of Fremantle, Mr Steve Rice and his documentary film crew, Dr Sue Summers, Managing Editor of the Black Swan Press, Mr Ray Coffee, Publisher at the WA Museum Press and staff.  A warm welcome was extended to everyone present, especially the Holodomor survivors and Ukrainian community in WA.

The MC thanked the Rostiazhka Ukrainian Dancers for their traditional Ukrainian gesture of welcome by offering the arriving guests bread and salt (complete with a nip of vodka!). Bread symbolizes a warm welcome, and salt - lasting friendship. The audience was asked to be mindful of the fact that our people could not get a single piece of bread, the most important staple, during the two most devastating years of famine, the Holodomor famine.

First to be invited to speak was Mr Mykola Mowczan, Head of the Ukrainian Association of WA, who, in his address, provided a solid historical background to the Holodomor period, brought to light critical problems in the Ukraine of today, and outlined biographical details about the book author, Dr Lesa Melnyczuk, as an academic and active member of the Ukrainian community.

Mr Alec Coles spoke briefly about the WA Museum and migration history. This was followed by Dr Lesa Melnyczuk’s informative and captivating presentation regarding the metamorphosis of thoughts, observations and experiences that led her to work on what became a massive project.  Lesa opened her heart to the audience which allowed us to share the palette of emotions arising from the confronting information to which she was being exposed.  And now, after seven years of dedication and perseverance, we can witness the fruition of her efforts.   [![](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Photo-Bohdan-Warchomij03892.jpg)

To further authenticate her work, the audience was able to view the excellent, fifteen minute documentary made by Lesa and her film crew of an interview with Holodomor survivor, Mrs Natalia Sirko, who spoke of her memories of the Holodomor. The film brought home the horror, tragedy and virtually indescribable depth of despair experienced by Mrs Sirko as a young girl, although her own experiences spoke for all the Holodomor survivors.  The audience was as if frozen in total silence upon the film’s end.

In paying tribute to Dr Melnyczuk’s achievement, the MC stated that _Lesa herself has been tested to the utmost with her own perseverance with this historically charged and emotionally challenging project. It was more than a labour of love. As the saying goes, a life with love will have some thorns, but a life without love will have no roses. We now have the rose of remembrance - it is a tribute to the hope, faith and resilience of the survivors as well as of the post-war immigrants in our community in Western Australia – such attributes must be admired, respected and treasured. Lesa’s achievement is indeed phenomenal -  to herself, her family, the community and to posterity_. The MC congratulated the author, and wished her all the very best for the future.

The programme concluded with our Rostiazhka dancers performing two traditional Ukrainian dances with the positive energy and joy that not only characterizes Ukrainian dancing, but also the qualities our Holodomor survivors and immigrants have shown us.   Guests were then able to mingle whilst enjoying a very lovely  afternoon tea.
