](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/fecca_logo.jpg)Are you an older person from a migrant background who has a story to tell about what it is like to be growing older in Australia, your experiences with the aged care system or your life as an immigrant?

If so The Federation of Ethnic Communities' Councils of Australia (FECCA) would like to hear your story.[![migrants](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/migrants.jpg)

FECCA believes that telling people’s stories is one of the most powerful forms of advocacy. A person’s story can cut to the heart of the issue and promote understanding in a way that statistics and policy analysis cannot.

The stories may be published in the Spring 2013 edition of FECCA’s Australian Mosaic magazine, which will focus on the theme of CALD aged care and on the FECCA website.

If you have a story to tell, or know someone who does, we would love to hear from you. Please contact Melanie Tulloch (melanie@fecca.org.au) or Bruce Shaw (bruce@fecca.org.au) by email or at the FECCA office on 02 6282 5755.
