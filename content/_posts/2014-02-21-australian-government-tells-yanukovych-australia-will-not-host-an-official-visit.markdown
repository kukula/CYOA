## **AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TELLS YANUKOVYCH AUSTRALIA WILL NOT HOST AN OFFICIAL VISIT**


As previously advised in late January 2014 senior Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials (DFAT) advised that Chargés d'Affaires** **of Ukraine in Australia Stanislav Stashevskyi was requested to meet with key officials to be provided with a direct Government-to-Government message.

Part of that message was that if President Yanukovych was thinking of visiting Australia the Australian Government would not host an official visit.

Given the current circumstances in Ukraine and the brutality of his regime this position should be followed by others
