It is important for all to be aware that the Rally to occur in Canberra on Saturday 19th February is not directed against the Russian people, including the Russian Community in Australia (RFA).  Components of the Rally are directed against the current ruling regime of Medvedev-Putin in Moscow.  Stefan Romaniw OAM, the chairman of the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) has written an open letter to the RFA fully explaining this fact.

The full letter is available here.  [Letter to RFA](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Letter-to-RFA-.pdf)
