](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ukraine-august-2012-124.jpg)Ukrainian World Congress (UWC) General Secretary and Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations AFUO Chairman Stefan Romaniw today met with the Head of Canadian Observer Mission Ambassador Derek Fraser in Kyiv.

Ambassador Fraser and his staff are funded by the Canada Ukraine Foundation and are undertaking research and analysis work in the lead up to the 2012 Parliamentary Elections in Ukraine this coming October.

The Mission is examining a range of issues that could have bearing on the elections and include;



	  * Gerrymandering (first report attached)
	  * Bullying and Bribing
	  * TV and Freedom of press
	  * Administration and  resources and funding of elections campaigns
	  * Election Laws

Ambassador Fraser will be preparing reports on all these issues.

Coordinating the election, monitoring processes, preparation of observers, the issues of working towards transparent elections were also discussed.

Mr Romaniw complemented the work being undertaken by the Canadian Government and the Ukrainian community in Canada and noted it as leading practice and should be used as a template for other Governments.

The AFUO will now approach the Australian Government again through the Minister for Foreign Affairs Bob Carr and chair of the Australian Ukraine Parliamentary Friendships Committee Senator Bilyk to send an Australian delegation to the elections.

"The road to democracy, stability and transparency in countries such as Ukraine will take some time. After 70 years of communism and oppression the Ukrainian people need the support of foreign governments  to ensure their rights are protected" , Mr Romaniw said

"The Australian Government should be contributing to this passage of time by sending its own observers." Mr Romaniw said

The AFUO will write to Minister Carr to brief him on the meeting with Ambassador Fraser.
