Danny McGinlay has done a lot of things to impress girls in the past, and from next Valentines Day, in the aptly named Chapel of Love Comedy Club, he’s ready to share with Adelaide the story of his biggest relationship challenge yet.

Living up to his accolades as _‘one of the best comedians in Australia’ _(Gold FM) Danny McGinlay demonstrates, in this hit show from the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, exactly how far he will go for a chick in Kiev.

A couple of years ago Danny proposed to his Ukrainian girlfriend, and to prove he was worthy of her and her family, enrolled in night school. For six months he had to learn a completely new thirty‐three‐letter alphabet, master the concept of hard and soft vowels and adapt to a language made up of sounds most people can’t even hear.

As seen on _Rove_, _The Project_, _The Footy Show _and _Adam Hills Tonight_, as well as the best comedy venues around the country, Danny McGinlay’s fresh, honest humour has audiences all over Australia in fits of laughter as they can relate, not so much to his own ludicrous experiences, but to his voracious appetite for making the most of out of life’s challenges.

Did Danny succeed in wrapping his tongue around a completely new language, and more importantly winning the hearts of his hesitant new family?

_‘A genuinely funny show that draws on our multicultural nature’ _**The Age**

_‘McGinlay is huge fun as he takes the audience through a tale of love, family, culture, oversized dogs, the death of Osama bin Laden and ultimately about learning Ukrainian’ _**Squirrel Comedy**

_‘His retelling of key events, from their first meeting to whole evenings lost in translation, is done so with a winning combination of humility, wit and warmth – no easy feat given the incorporation of a language best described as guttural.’ _**Herald Sun**
