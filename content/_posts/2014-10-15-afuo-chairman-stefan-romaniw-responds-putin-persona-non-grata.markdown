STEFAN ROMANIW, AUST. FED. OF UKRAINIAN ORGANISATIONS: He should be a persona non grata, not allowed into Australia. He doesn't deserve to be sitting at that table.

TONY ABBOTT: Look, I'm going to shirt-front Mr Putin. You bet you are - you bet I am. I am going to be saying to Mr Putin, "Australians were murdered. They were murdered by Russian-backed rebels using Russian-supplied equipment. We are very unhappy about this."
