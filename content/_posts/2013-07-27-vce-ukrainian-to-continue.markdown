Dear Mr Romaniw



**Re: The impact of small candidatures on the provision of Ukrainian at Year 12 level**



The Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority participates with other curriculum and assessment authorities across Australia in the delivery and assessment of many language subjects through the Collaborative Curriculum and Assessment Framework for Languages (CCAFL) Project.

This collaboration enables the national provision of small candidature language subjects for study at Year 11 and Year 12 that can be accredited towards the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE).

Authorities involved in the CCAFL program share the costs for curriculum development and the setting, vetting and marking of examinations and the collaboration of experts from various States and Territories. This enables the provision of an important service to language communities by making language courses available at Year 11 and Year 12 that may otherwise be unsustainable.

The provision of language subjects of very low candidature is, however, resource intensive. The Boards of Studies and curriculum and assessment authorities across Australia have decided that three criteria need to be met to ensure the continued provision of a language at Senior Secondary level.  One of these criteria states that where the national candidature of a nationally assessed language falls below a total of 15 students, for each of 3 consecutive years, the language subject will be suspended until such time as there is evidence that projected student numbers have risen significantly.

In 2012, the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority wrote to advise you that as the projected numbers for Ukrainian for 2012 had risen to 15 nationally, an extension to the suspension of Ukrainian had been granted for one year, while ACACA reviewed its policy in relation to the reactivation of suspended languages and the determination of evidence that will be used to demonstrate a language’s viability.

As the national candidature for Ukrainian_ _was 15 in 2012, the CCAFL National Reference Group has agreed that the suspension of this subject will no longer proceed as advised in 2012. Should enrolments in any year fall below a total of 15 students nationally, the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority will write to you again with further advice.

I would like to acknowledge the contribution made by the Ukrainian speaking community and others in supporting the study of Ukrainian language across Australia.

If you require any clarification of this letter, please contact Maree Dellora. Curriculum Manager, Languages on 9032 1692 or email: [dellora.maree.m@edumail.vic.gov.au](mailto:dellora.maree.m@edumail.vic.gov.au).





Yours sincerely
