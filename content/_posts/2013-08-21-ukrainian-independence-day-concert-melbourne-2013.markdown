#### **_17       _**Ukrainian Bandurist Ensemble




_The bandura is a traditional plucked-string musical instrument from Ukraine which evolved from a line of lute-like instruments in Ukraine.  An 11-th century fresco in Kiev city's Saint Sofia Cathedral shows a possible ancestor.  The main distinguishing characteristics are the absence of frets, which means that each string can sound only one note, as in a harp, and, secondly, the presence of treble strings stretched over the soundboard, off centre from the bass strings which run along the neck. The result is an asymmetric body._




_From 15th to 18th centuries, bandura was played by kobzars (wandering minstrels, usually blind and sometimes led by a child) and kozaks (cossacks, or free warriors).  In the villages and towns, kobzars sang epic songs (dumy) about the people's exploits and relations with Turks and Tatars, and later of their troubles with the Polish regime.  Because the kobzars were a nationalistic force, the Soviet Union government liquidated them in the 1930s. _
