### Western Sydney Wanderers support war-affected kids in Ukraine


New South Wales soccer club the Western Sydney Wanderers has generously donated uniforms to a youth soccer team in the war-torn city of Luhansk in Ukraine.

Australian-Ukrainian, Jaroslav Duma OAM, came into contact with the youth team, Kolos, during a recent visit to Ukraine to volunteer with not-for-profit organisation Patriot Defence. The children lacked uniforms to play in the regional soccer competition in Novoaidar Raion in eastern Ukraine.

Upon his return to Australia Mr Duma together with fellow Ukrainian community member, Mr Roman Dechnicz, approached Western Sydney through its solicitor, Elias el Khoury, seeking outfits for the Ukrainian team to play in. The club, known for its strong community focus, responded to the request agreeing to supply 20 uniforms in the spirit of promoting the world game.

“This is a great show of kindness by the Wanderers. Many of the children’s parents are fighting in the war, so that their kids can grow up in a free Ukraine.” said Mr Duma.

“Soccer grants them a degree of normality amidst the chaos in their country.” Mr Duma said.

His Excellency the Ambassador of Ukraine to Australia, Dr Mykola Kulynych, together with Mr Duma and Mr Dechnicz had the pleasure of meeting with Western Sydney officials at the Blacktown International Sportspark to receive the outfits. Mr Duma will deliver them to the team during his upcoming visit to Ukraine.

The conflict in Ukraine began over two years ago when the Russian Federation annexed the Ukrainian peninsula Crimea and invaded eastern Ukraine.
