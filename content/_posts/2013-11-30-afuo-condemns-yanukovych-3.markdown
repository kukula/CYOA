](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SRomaniw.jpg)Following the failure of the Ukrainian President Yanukovych to sign the EU integration agreement at the Vilnius EU summit, the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) condemns the deliberate about-face of the president and his cabinet in this matter.  A statement to this effect has been issued.

Text of statement: [post Vilnius afuo statement](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/post-Vilnius-afuo-statement.pdf)

_Stefan Romaniw, the AFUO Chairman and General Secretary of the Ukrainian World Congress is currently in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv._

**Following the farce in Vilnius, the Ukrainian riot police Berkut have started a vicious crackdown on the, up till now peaceful, massed protesters in Kyiv.  And the authorities have now threatened sudden unscheduled “audits” against educational institutes where students announced strikes in connection with the refusal to sign the European Union Association Agreement.**
