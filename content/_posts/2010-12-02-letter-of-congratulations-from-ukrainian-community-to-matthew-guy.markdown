**The Hon Matthew Guy**

**Minister for Planning**

**C/- Parliament House **

**Spring Street **

**Melbourne  3000**

Dear Minister,

The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) extends its congratulations to the Liberal Coalition on its victory in the Victorian State Elections on November 27, 2010.

The AFUO also congratulates and salutes you for your appointment as Minister for Planning in the new Baillieu Cabinet.

Australia's Ukrainian community is proud of the fact that a Victorian of Ukrainian background has achieved such high office.

Your hard work, energy, commitment and tireless efforts have now been rewarded. The community has watched you grow into a formidable and mature politician.

Your commitment to the Ukrainian community in Australia and Victoria in particular should be noted. You have been active in a number of areas.

Some of these are :



	  * advice and assistance with media in the period of the Orange Revolution
	  * studying Ukrainian at Monash University
	  * political activity in ensuring the Holodomor is recognised as genocide
	  * initiating annual Parliamentary visits to Ukraine
	  * inspiration to younger members of the Ukrainian community
	  * regular participation in community events

are but a few of your community achievements.

We wish you well in your role as Minister and trust your connection with the Ukrainian community will grow even stronger.

The AFUO also wishes your wife and young family the strength required in public life. Sharing their husband and father with community is not easy at times. The benefit however, is your participation in processes that will result in a stronger and better future

Best wishes
