This thrilling piece of cinema is based on a remarkable true story and tells the tale of a disenchanted KGB agent who at the height of the Cold War passed classified information out of Moscow.

FAREWELL is a thriller in the mould of 'The Lives of Others' set during the Cold War. Directed by Christian Carion (Joyeux Noel)and starring two of Europe's most respected actors/directors Emir Kusturica and Guillaume Canet, Kusturica stars as Colonel Grigoriev of the KGB. Disenchanted by Communism, Grigoriev decides he must take

advantage of his position to help change the world. Discreetly making contact with Moscow-based French engineer Pierre (Canet), Grigoriev begins to pass along documents that will eventually arrive in the hands of United States operatives. Containing information that is

amongst the most important to emerge from behind the Iron Curtain, French President Francois Mitterrand and Ronald Reagan (Fred Ward)personally vet the documents supplied by the Moscow source, who is given the codename: Farewell.

Focusing on the human element of the people involved as well as the deeper political content, Farewell is a well-crafted, complex and intelligent film that gives new perspective to the double dealing that eventually brought the whole USSR deck of cards down.
