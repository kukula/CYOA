The AFUO has written an open letter to Ukraine's President Viktor Yanukovych expressing Australian Ukrainians' dismay  with the many anti-Ukrainian - pro-Russian positions being taken by him and his Government



	  * The signing  of Black Sea Fleet Accord
	  * The Europe parliaments intrusion in Ukraine's affairs  on the Bandera issue
	  * The anti constitutional activity of the Government
	  * President's  statement of retractions on the Holodomor  as being not an act of Genocide

amongst others.

All 22 members of the AFUO signed the Memorandum which was presented to Ukraine's Ambassador in Australia.

The AFUO called on the President to keep true to his word and not be a puppet of Russia. It also called on the President to rescind the anti-Ukrainian resolutions and accords.
