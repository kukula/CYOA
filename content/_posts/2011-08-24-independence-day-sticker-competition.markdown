The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) recently organised and received 21 entries for the 20th Anniversary of Ukraine’s Independence Sticker Competition.

All the designs were presented to ONLY the AFUO Board members in an anonymous fashion where they were voted on.

All the submitted designs are shown here:

Once all the votes were cast and counted there was a clear winner, with 2nd through to 7th place extremely close.

AFUO wish to thank and congratulate all the participants, especially the entrant of the winning design.

AFUO will to also thank Dnister Ukrainian Credit Co-operative for agreeing to participate in providing a prize of $200 to the winning entry.

The designer of the winning entry wishes to remain anonymous and donate the prize money towards printing costs of the stickers, for which we are extremely grateful.

We encourage you ALL to buy the winning design sticker and display it on your car windows.

Stickers can be purchased at your local community organisation or alternatively on eBay - [http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/UKRAINE-20th-Anniversary-Independence-2011-STICKER-/350485275733?pt=AU_Car_Parts_Accessories&hash=item519a8ce455](http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/UKRAINE-20th-Anniversary-Independence-2011-STICKER-/350485275733?pt=AU_Car_Parts_Accessories&hash=item519a8ce455)
