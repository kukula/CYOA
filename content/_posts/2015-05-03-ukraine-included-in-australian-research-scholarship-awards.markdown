MEDIA RELEASE


**Ukraine included in Australian research scholarship awards**


Australia’s Minister for Education and Training, the Hon Christopher Pyne MP, has announced the opening of applications for the 2016 round of the Endeavour Scholarships and Fellowships. The list of eligible countries participating in the 2016 round has been expanded to include Ukraine.

The Endeavour Scholarships and Fellowships aim to build Australia’s reputation for excellence in the provision of education and research, support the internationalisation of the Australian higher education and research sectors and offer high-achieving individuals from overseas and Australia opportunities to increase their productivity and expertise in their field.

The Endeavour scholarships are open to international students to study an Australian qualification in Australia, including at vocational education and training institutions. This is further supported by Endeavour fellowships available to international postgraduate students and researchers to undertake research in Australia.

Minister Pyne said that the Endeavour programmes and the New Colombo Plan are important parts of the Government’s strategy for promoting international educational linkages for Australia.

The inclusion of Ukraine in the Endeavour Scholarships follows the recent establishment in Kyiv of an interim Australian Embassy.

More information on the Endeavour Scholarships and Fellowships is available at: [http://internationaleducation.gov.au/endeavour](http://internationaleducation.gov.au/endeavour). The deadline for applications is 30 June 2015.
