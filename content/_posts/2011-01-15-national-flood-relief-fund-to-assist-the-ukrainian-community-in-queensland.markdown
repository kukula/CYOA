announces




A national Flood Relief Fund to assist the Ukrainian Community and Ukrainians in Queensland, affected by the floods.




Donations can be made into the AFUO account in the Dnister Ukrainian Credit Cooperative:
_BSB:_ 704-235
_Account Number:_ 02801992
_Name of Account:_ Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations




We call on state community organisations to coordinate the activity. The AFUO executive tomorrow will send out Relief Fund forms to all communities. We appeal to our clergy to conduct a separate collection for this purpose.




AFUO Executive
