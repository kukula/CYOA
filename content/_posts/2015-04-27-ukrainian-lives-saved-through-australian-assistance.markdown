**UKRAINIAN LIVES SAVED THROUGH AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE**


The Australian Government’s support for a project aimed at saving the lives of accident victims in Ukraine is very welcome, said the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) today.

“Patriot Defence” – a humanitarian initiative of the Ukrainian World Congress of which AFUO is a member – will use the support to introduce a comprehensive medical training course for the newly formed Kyiv Traffic Patrol.

The new course will see patrol officers taught first aid for sustaining life, preventing further injuries, and caring for victims until medical personnel arrive at accident scenes. Some 1600 officers will complete the course and receive Individual First Aid Kits (IFAKSs); 210 first aid kits will be installed in patrol cars, and; on-going training centre will be established as a legacy.

Mr Stefan Romaniw OAM, President of the AFUO and Secretary General of the Ukrainian World Congress, said:

“Support by the Australian Government for first aid capability in the new Kyiv Traffic Patrol of the Ministry of the Interior will save lives. The course will bring Ukrainian traffic patrolmen up to the standards we almost take for granted in places like Australia and that Ukrainians deserve too.

“The support shows the effectiveness of having locally-based diplomatic representation. It can spot the opportunities to make a difference and then take action for the benefit of both Australia and Ukraine.

“The support comes in the context of the Government of Ukraine completely restructuring and reforming the Traffic Patrol into a modern and honest organisation that’s there to promote safety – something Ukrainians have long wished for.”

Dr Ulana Suprun, Director of Humanitarian Initiatives of the Ukrainian World Congress and Founder of “Patriot Defence”, said:

“We strongly thank the Australian Government and the Embassy of Australia in Ukraine for their support. We are pleased to now be applying the expertise of ‘Patriot Defence’ instructors to public administration and civil society projects as Ukraine moves into the future.

“This example features great cooperation between the Australian Government, the diasporan Ukrainian community, an agency of the Ukrainian Government, and a Ukraine-based NGO. The return on investment and cooperation will be the lives of people who get injured in traffic accidents.”

To date, AFUO has raised some $100,000 in community funds for the work of “Patriot Defence”, including its projects to provide first aid training to Ukraine’s self-defence personnel.
