### **Ukrainian Association of West Australia Inc. (UAWA)**


 **The committee of the Ukrainian Association take this belated opportunity to wish everyone a Joyous Christmas and a Happy New Year and look forward to doing it again with on January 14 for our Malanka**

 Whatever you call it Malanka ~ The Old New Year ~ Старый Новый год ~ Старий Новий рік ~ is the New Year according to the Julian Calendar!

 The tradition of the Old New Year has been kept in Ukraine ([Malanka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malanka)), Armenia, Moldova, Georgia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and the Republic of Macedonia. In the first half of the 20th century, segments of the Scottish Gaelic community still observed the feast and today, groups such as Edinburgh's Am Bothan see this as a convenient date for Gaelic events._ (extract from Wikipedia)_

 So if you know anyone from these countries ask them to join you at this year’s Malanka !!!

 The buffet meal is extravagantly catered featuring cuisines from Italy, India and Australia and will go from 7:30pm to 10:00pm

For your entertainment and pleasure we have secured one of Perth's great Rock'n'Roll Bands - Chain Reaction and floorshow by the famous Western Australian - Roztiazhka Cossack Dancers.
