The 9 metre tall forged stainless steel and copper gum tree spanning nearly five metres in diameter was created in response to the Black Saturday fires in Victoria in 2009.  This tree is a memorial to the 173 people who lost their lives in the bushfires, to honour the people who defended others and to stand as a symbol of regeneration for the community.

Though the project commenced in Victoria, there was an overwhelming response from blacksmiths around the world, including the Ukrainian Union of Artist Blacksmiths.  Ukrainian blacksmiths from Ivano-Frankivsk forged a large portion of the more than 3,500 leaves and twigs.
