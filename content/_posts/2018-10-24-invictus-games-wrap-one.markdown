Local Ukrainian cultural groups also performed, with Zahrava Dance Ensemble performed a vibrant Hopak as well as the Youth Bandurist Ensemble playing touching songs to name a few. The community then had the chance to meet and chat with the Team, many also taking the opportunity to take photos too.

The Team was also presented with handwritten letters from Ukrainian Community School students in Noble Park, Victoria. These were hand delivered by teacher Mrs Svitlana on their behalf.
