The Melbourne Accordion Orchestra, formed in 2002, consists of musicians who play not only accordions but also drums, bass guitar, xylophone, guitar, keyboard and percussion. The orchestra, conducted by Iryna Stepko, has a repertoire which includes classical, popular, ethnic and traditional music.  Its musicians can play solo and have an extensive range of pieces including tangos, waltzes, polkas and marches.  They also cater for different ethnic backgrounds: Italian, French, Scandinavian, German, Ukrainian, Brazilian, Argentinean and others.
