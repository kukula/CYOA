](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/launch_banner.gif)It starts with a vision and slowly but surely it progresses to a wonderful portal of information, connectivity and tool for Ukrainian Australians.  The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations are pleased to welcome you to your new website.

"Our vision is to start a portal where everything and anything Ukrainian in Australia has a home and place to stay, whether it be an Organisation, a community event or current affair." explains Stefan Romaniw.

We hope it is informative, current and interactive, bringing you news and events Nationally and Internationally, designed to encourage posts, comments and forums.  A special thank you to our communications committee for their voluntary work and commitment, namely our Marketing and Communications Director -  Sonja van de Camp and her team -  Helena and Warren Denley, Anna Kaminskyj, Stefan Potashnyk, Natalia Tkaczuk and Gregory Lubczenko, who have worked collectively in bringing this tool to you.
