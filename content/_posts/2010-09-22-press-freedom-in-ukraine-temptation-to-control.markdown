Report by Jean-François Julliard and Elsa Vidal - August 2010 


<blockquote>Reporters Without Borders visited Ukraine from 19 to 21 July in order to accomplish the first part of an evaluation of the press freedom situation.

It met national and local media representatives, members of press freedom NGOs (Stop Censorship, Telekritika, SNUJ and IMI), ruling party and opposition parliamentarians and representatives of the prosecutor-general’s office.

At the end of this initial visit, Reporters Without Borders gave a news conference in Kiev on 21 July at which it announced its provisional findings and its recommendations to the authorities.

Reporters Without Borders will return to Ukraine in response to an invitation to meet with President Viktor Yanukovych and Anna German, the deputy chief of the presidential administration, and in order to meet with other representatives of the state media.

This report summarizes the information that Reporters Without Borders used to reach its initial conclusions.</blockquote>
