**AUSTRALIA’S UKRAINIAN COMMUNITY STRONGLY CONDEMNS DESECRATION OF GRAVES AT SYDNEY’S ROOKWOOD CEMETERY**


Senseless acts of vandalism desecrated over 50 graves at Rookwood Cemetery in Sydney, one of the oldest and biggest multicultural cemeteries in Australia, last weekend .

The Ukrainian and Greek section of the cemetery was vandalised causing over half a million dollars worth of damage.

Australia’s peak body for Ukrainians, the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) strongly condemns these acts of vandalism.

Many of the damaged graves of Ukrainian and Greek community members have left their families upset and distraught.

“One needs to question the mentality of those responsible. To destroy places of rest of citizens who built this country is disgraceful,” Mr Stefan Romaniw OAM Chairman of the AFUO said.

“The impact on families seeing graves erected in memory of their close ones vandalised is horrendous.” Mr Romaniw.

“Authorities must investigate and charge those responsible. The Courts must then send a strong message that desecrating peoples’ place of rest is off limits, un Australian and will not be tolerated.” Mr Romaniw.

The cost to families will be huge. Some may not be in a position to repair the damage.

The AFUO calls on cemetery authorities and the State Government to meet with the effected families and examine avenues to assist.

“Places of burial and graves are sacrosanct. Those who destroy them have no respect for life or death and should feel the full brunt of the law. There can be no excuses in this case,” Mr Romaniw said.
