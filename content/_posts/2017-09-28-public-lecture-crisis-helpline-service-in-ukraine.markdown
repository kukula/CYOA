#### A fantastic opportunity to hear from Executive Director of Lifeline, Alan Woodward.


Thanks to the help of AFUO, Alan travelled to Ukraine to evaluate the possibility of establishing the organisation Lifeline.

**A synopsis of the lecture:Â **

There are estimated to be more than 1,000 crisis helpline services

worldwide. They include telephone and other technology channels for

delivery such as online chat, text and messaging and email.

As Ukraine strengthens and reforms its service system for mental health

and wellbeing to service its population, which is going through substantial

challenge and transitions, a national crisis helpline service would be an

appropriate initiative enabling a responsive approach to suicide prevention

on a national scale. A first step should be a statement of strategic

intent guiding the development of a national crisis helpline and articulating

its intended benefits. The national crisis helpline should ideally be

operated by a non-government organization, encouraging the involvement

of community supports and the development of a charitable sector

in Ukraine as part of the overall direction of mental health and wellbeing

reforms.

**When:** 9th October 2017, 6:30pm-8pm.

**Where:** Lecture Theatre HB40
(Basement level)
Building H
Caulfield Campus
