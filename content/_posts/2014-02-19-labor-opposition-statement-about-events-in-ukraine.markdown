The Labor Opposition expresses deep concern about the violence in Ukraine’s capital, Kiev.

Reports indicate Kiev has experienced its worst day of violence since demonstrations began around 12 weeks ago.

We condemn any use of force against peaceful demonstrators.

Labor wants all Ukrainians to be able to exercise their democratic rights and have a say in the future of their country.

We strongly encourage all parties to resolve their concerns peacefully through dialogue, without further bloodshed.
