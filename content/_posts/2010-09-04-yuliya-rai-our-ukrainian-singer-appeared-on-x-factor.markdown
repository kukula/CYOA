Yuliya has performed a number of times at the Ukrainian Community Centre in Brisbane.

In fact Yuliya just performed at the Ukrainian Independence day concert in Brisbane on 22 August 2010.

We already know she is great.

Lets hope the judges see her at her best.

Good Luck Yuliya!!!!!!!!l

I know Ukrainians in Australia are proud of our Yuliya.

## X FACTOR - HOW IT WORKS




### Audition Stages


The four judges - Kyle Sandilands, Natalie Imbruglia, Guy Sebastian and Ronan Keating - all work together at this stage of the competition. An act must receive at least three 'yes's' in order to make it through to the next stage of the competition - Bootcamp.


### Bootcamp


At Bootcamp, the judges will be allocated a category to mentor. The contestants who received at least three ‘yes’s’ will be put through their paces to see if they can take on different song genres and assess if they have the enigmatic ‘X Factor.’ The judges will select their most promising contestants from each of their four categories to take to the next stage of the competition - Judge's Houses.


### **Judge's House's**


At the Judge’s Houses stage, each judge will pick their three favourite acts to represent them in the live studio shows. They will bring in big guns from the entertainment industry to help them choose their top three acts.


### Live studio shows


The live shows will start later this year. After watching their performance in the live show the public will vote for their favourite act to stay in the competition. In the results show, the two acts with the lowest public vote will sing once again for the Judges and the Judges will vote on who they think deserve to stay in the competition and who should go home.
