Recently we posted an article about a new publication '_Silent Memories - Traumatic Lives'_ due to be released in March 2012. 




 




Further to this we have a brief piece written by Mykola Mowczan, the president of the Ukrainian Association  in Western Australia (UAWA) about the author of the publication, Dr Lesa Melnyczuk Morgan.

Last year on the 11th  of December, my wife and I had the great pleasure to attend the presentation of Dr Lesa

Melnyczyk's Ph.D.  It was a joyous occasion to see a personal friend and a passionate Ukrainian receive a truly deserved  acknowledgement for her arduous and tireless work. But Dr Lesa Melnyczuk's work had started again. It has taken almost a year from that date to find financing, a publisher and to finally get her doctoral thesis ready for publication.




Today you have the opportunity to participate in the Special Pre-Publication Offer Price of $36 for the book "Silent Memories Traumatic Lives: Ukrainian Migrant Refugees in WA" 




Below is an excerpt from Dr Lesa Melnyczuk's email and in the attachments a pre-order form for her Doctoral Thesis "Silent Memories Traumatic Lives: Ukrainian Migrant Refugees in WA" 




All you need to do is download the attachment, complete the form and post it to the Western Australian Museum Shop  45 Cliff Street, Framantle WA 6160 AUSTRALIA.

Also, the Ukrainian Association of WA invites everyone to the Holodomor Commemorative Panakhyda (requiem) to be held at the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, 2 Ferguson St Maylands on Sunday November 27th. The Panakhyda will commence at 11:30 am (after both Ukrainian Orthodox and Catholic services). ** **













Following the Panakhyda you are invited to the Orthodox Church Hall for a light lunch and refreshments. The UAWA has invited Dr Lesa Melnyczuk to make a presentation. 

Thank you

Dr Lesa Melnyczuk Morgan has also provided a brief background to her work:

**** **Subject:** New Book: Silent Memories Traumatic Lives: Ukrainian Migrant Refugees in WA







Dear Colleagues and friends,

I believe that you would be interested in my forthcoming publication resulting from my Doctoral research in WA focussing upon the Holodomor but uncovering much more in the process.

I have attached the pre-order flier from my publisher in Fremantle, WA. The work is in English in order to attract a wider audience than our Ukrainian speaking diaspora.

I have been most grateful to receive some  funding support from the **Ukrainian Studies Foundation** in Australia for this publication that will become part of a new migrant history series in WA called “We Came By Ship.”

This is the first publication regarding Holodomor survivors stories from WA but also including material from Elizabeth Water’s study that appeared to collect interviews from each state (interview tapes have gone missing from the original collection). Waters was provided with funding to collect the interviews and complete the research project (beginning in the 1980s) however she then transferred to England without completing the work and the final write-up. I have been given permission by her to use what is left of the material in my Doctoral thesis available online.

Best wishes,

_Dr Lesa Melnyczuk Morgan_
