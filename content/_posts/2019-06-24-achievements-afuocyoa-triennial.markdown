On Saturday 22nd June, AFUO/CYOA had its XXVIII triennial meeting.

This meeting serves three purposes:



 	  * To reflect on the past three years work and thank the incumbent executive and committees for their work
 	  * To elect a new executive and committees for the 2019-2022 period
 	  * To begin planning for the following three year period

You can read our triennial report, detailing our achievements over the past three years.
