The Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain (AUGB) has posted links on its website to two programmes that were aired on 13th January 2012 on BBC Radio 4 regarding the 1932-33 Holodomor (famine) in Ukraine.

See:  [**http://www.augb.co.uk/news-page.php?id=766**](http://www.augb.co.uk/news-page.php?id=766)  for details.  The programmes are well worth listening to
