The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations is financially supporting the Embassy of Australia in Kyiv Cultural Program.

Ana de la Vega, a highly regarded Australian flautist based in Berlin, will be performing at the Philharmonic in Kyiv on Monday 26 September, in concert with the Kyiv Camerata chamber orchestra. This concert will be part of the Philharmonic’s standard program season.

On Tue 27 or Wed 28 Sept, Ana will be leading a masterclass at the Tchaikovsky Musical Academy, and that evening performing a public recital at the academy.

On Sat 1 and Sun 2 October, Ana will be performing in Lviv at the Philharmonic, as part of the ‘Contrasts’ contemporary music festival.

Great to see cultural exchange!

Well done Embassy in Kyiv.
