We are OK. Uki Club all good. River level did not rise as predicted. Many properties spared. Thank God. I'm not sure or think assistance required at this time. Authorities managed the situation very well. I don't think any uki loss of life . Some ukis could have been affected .I don't believe lives in danger. Thanks for caring . I have spoken with many uki people who were dealing with affects of flood OK

**Floods in Queensland
**

Christ is Born!
Your Excellency,
Regarding the situation in Queensland:-
The three families I spoke about in my last report who were in danger â€“ are no longer so. However, two are still isolated and one family still has water under the house.
The most damage was suffered by our people in the suburbs of Oxley, Rockley and the surrounding areas.
The Oxley community hall is flooded as are a number of other houses.
Unfortunately, it is very hard to make phone calls to our people mainly because the power has been off for the last two days.
I cannot travel to these areas.
There seems to be a problem in that the insurance companies are refusing to cover claims from houses in low lying areas. This is a tremendous additional burden for our people.
In Brisbane the power has been turned off in the area of the Ukrainian hall. Parts of Cordelia Street, near the hall, are flooded. It looks like the Malanka will be cancelled.
Thank God that the flood did not reach the 1974 levels.
There was water about 300 metres from the church but you would need another 5.5 metres to flood the house behind the church and about 7 metres to flood the church.
Let us continue to pray and we ask you for prayers.

Wishing you a blessed day.
Fr. Jarko Pasok
