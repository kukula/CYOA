Documentary maker **Kitty Green** -- who spent a year in her grandmother’s native Ukraine filming with the women of Ukraine’s topless feminist movement ‘Femen’ -- is the creator of the hit documentary, _Ukraine is not a Brothel_, which not only got Kitty arrested many times but also made her an international sensation. The winner of the 2015 AACTA Award for 'Best Feature Documentary' and the 'Lina Mangiacapre Award-Special Mention' at the Venice Film Festival, the doco has played at festivals internationally to great acclaim. Kitty's newest short doco, _The Face of Ukraine: Casting Oksana Baiul_ also won the Short Film Jury Prize at Sundance earlier this year.

Join Kitty Green in conversation with Sue Maslin as they discuss her provocative documentary films and her approach to documenting activism.

Tickets are free. More info on the AFTRS site [http://www.aftrs.edu.au/events/friday-on-my-mind](http://www.aftrs.edu.au/events/friday-on-my-mind)
