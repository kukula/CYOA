## REMEMBERING THE MILLIONS WHO PERISHED IN UKRAINE'S  1932 -33 FAMINE -  ACT OF GENOCIDE




### ........Millions were children and infants


"The Ukrainian World Congress (UWC) calls upon the Australian and international community to commemorate the  anniversary of the 1932-33 Holodomor on Saturday November 24, 2012, and duly pay respect to the innocent victims of this genocide of the Ukrainian people, "  General Secretary of the UWC and Chair of the International Coordinating Committee for  Holodomor Recognition, Stefan Romaniw OAM said today

"Declassified Government Archives now categorically  prove and point  to fact that Stalin's Communist regime committed a crime against humanity, a blatant act of genocide against the Ukrainian nation" Mr Romaniw said

" As we look at the many horrific acts in the world at this very time, history lessons such as Stalin's outright disrespect for human  life needs to be remembered and learnt,  so the same atrocities do not continue to be repeated" Mr Romaniw said

The UWC and the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) call on the  Australian Parliament to pass a motion  denouncing and condemning this act of genocide and to call  on all Australians to  acknowledge and commemorate the International Day of Remembrance, the  last Saturday of November gazetted by the Ukrainian Government in respect of those who suffered and perished in the great famine of 1932-33.

"At this time we announce  the UWC International Coordinating Committee for  Holodomor Recognition and  AFUO  plans for the 80th Anniversary commemorations"  Mr Romaniw said



	  * Initiate the collation of a Remembrance Book of all Holodomor survivors who still live or lived in Australia to add to the Volumes of Remembrance books in Ukraine
	  * Initiate the formation of the _International Group of Children of Survivors_ _and those who perished_ . The Australian contingent will join the international  group who will travel  to Ukraine next year to participate in  international commemorations with a strong message -_We will not allow our parents -grandparents plight to be forgotten. The flame burns on _
	  * Continue  to pressure the  Government of Ukraine  through   its Permanent  Representative   in the United National to call on the UN  to acknowledge the Holodomor as Genocide .
	  * Commence discussions  with Australian schools  to have the Holodomor  included as a study in world history in Australian schools
	  * Conduct an International conference  to place on the public record the facts rather than the old Soviet disinformation machine  that continues to be pumped out by some Australian and other  academics

"We call on the Australian and State Governments  to pass resolutions  on the Holodomor in the coming week and show international leadership and solidarity with the countries that have   categorically condemned this atrocity." Mr Romaniw said

"We need to stop being fence sitters and take a resolute position . That will show that Australia is serious  when it  introduces and supports laws  that protect the human rights". Mr Romaniw said

"We also call on all Australians to light a Candle  of Remembrance on Saturday November 24,  International Day of Remembrance in sign of respect but also as a reflection and commitment that we as individuals, we as a nation will not tolerate nor allow these atrocities against mankind to go without notice and  condemnation." Mr Romaniw said .
