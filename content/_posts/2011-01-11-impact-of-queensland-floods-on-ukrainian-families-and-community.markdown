IMPACT OF QUEENSLAND FLOODS ON UKRAINIAN FAMILIES AND COMMUNITY


The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) extends is sympathy to the families who have lost loved ones in the current floods in Queensland, Australia.

Our prayers and thoughts are with the Queensland community, which is undergoing this horrific unforseen event. Many have lost homes, property and memories as floods tear through different parts of the State.

The AFUO has been in contact with the local clergy Most Rev Father Mykola Serdiuk (UAOC) and Fr Jarko Pasok (UGCC) and the President of the Association of Ukrainians in Queensland (AUQ) Stephen Chomyn and the local Oxley community to establish the impact of the floods on Ukrainian families and the community.

From all reports at this time there has been some property damage, but this is limited.

The AFUO has offered support to the community. It is in regular contact with community leaders.

As the situation unravels the AFUO Executive in cooperation with local leadership will discuss what assistance will be required to assist people in rebuilding their lives.

The AFUO calls on community members to keep the Queensland community in their prayers at this time.

The AUQ has cancelled all Ukrainian New Year’s celebrations planned for this weekend.
