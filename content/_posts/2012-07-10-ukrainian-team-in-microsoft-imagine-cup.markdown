](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ms-imagine-cup-logo-thumb.jpg)The Microsoft Imagine Cup is the world’s premier student technology competition.

Ukrainian teams are competing in 3 different competitions of the Imagine Cup:

-        Software Design (the “main” competition, the winner of which receives the Imagine Cup itself) – Ukraine is represented by the team from Donetsk, which made it to Top 6 out of 72 countries presented in the worldwide finals!

-        Game Design – Ukraine is represented by the team from Odessa. They made the Top 10 worldwide, but unfortunately, did not make it to the Top 5 and thus do not have chances to get the medals

-        Windows 8 – Ukrainian team from Simferopol made it to Top 3 worldwide and thus are guaranteed to get the medals or even the top spot

The competition has been covered extensively by American and Ukrainian press, for example: [http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/09/enable-talk-imagine-cup/](http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/09/enable-talk-imagine-cup/)
