### **_RUSSIA AND THE MINSK AGREEMENT_**


Labor is deeply troubled by Russia’s failure to release hostages and illegally detained people in accordance with the terms of the Minsk Agreement signed over a year ago.

This includes the prominent Ukrainian pilot and member of the Ukrainian Parliament, Nadiya Savchenko, who Russia has held without trial for more than 18 months.

NATO, the United States, Canada, and the European Union have made similar calls on Russia.

The path to a sustainable peace in eastern Ukraine demands all parties meet their obligations under the Minsk agreement.  Labor urges them to do so.
