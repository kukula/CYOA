**Hopak in the Park - Ukrainian Cossack Dance Spectacular
**


MELBOURNE will spring into action in spectacular style when an army of Ukrainian Cossack dancers hit the Sidney Myer Music Bowl on April 30, 2011 from 1.00pm to 6.00pm.

Witness a cast of more than 300 Ukrainian dancers from across Australia kick up a storm as they showcase centuries of dazzling dance moves in the outdoor extravaganza Hopak In the Park.

Featuring Australia's best Ukrainian dance ensembles and musical acts - including the _Cossack Brothers_, _Iskra_, _Roztiazhka_, _Verchovyna_, _Veselka_, _Volya_, _Yevshan_ and _Zahrava_ - the inaugural Ukrainian Dance Festival promises to captivate Melbourne audiences with an afternoon feast of high-flying kicks, breathtaking spins and jaw-dropping leaps.

Special guest band _Hrim_ from New York and popular young music talent _S.o.V_ also join a local line-up for a fusion of traditional Ukrainian tunes and funky beats.

Grab your friends and family to experience the unforgettable debut of **Hopak In the Park**.

Don't miss out - You won't be disappointed!
