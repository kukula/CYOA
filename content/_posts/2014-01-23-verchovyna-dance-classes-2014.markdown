## **Welcome**** to 2014******


Dance classes resume **Tuesday 11th February 6.00pm** at the Ukrainian Hall, Russell Street, Essendon.

NEW DANCERS WELCOME!

If you are new and would like a registration pack please email [info@verchovyna.com.au](mailto:info@verchovyna.com.au?subject=Registrations%202014). or say hello to the registration team on the day.

KINDER ENROLMENTS

Dancers are able to join the kinder group at the commencement of Term 1 if they turn 4yrs of age by 30th April 2013.

Keep in mind that teachers will assess ‘early starters’ and advise parents if children are not ready for the group. Children will stay with their peers in line with school years, as they progress through Verchovyna classes.

We look forward to our 2014 Program!
