National Youth Week (NYW) is the largest celebration of young people on the Australian youth calendar.  The event provides an opportunity for young people to express their ideas, showcase their talents, have their voices heard on issues that affect their lives, celebrate their positive contribution to the community and most importantly, have fun.  The celebrations will run from 13 - 22 April 2012.

 Funding will be available for organisations to host a NYW event that brings young people together.  Priority will be given to applications that provide opportunities for young people to express their ideas and views, celebrate the positive contribution young people make to the community, or encourage the participation of diverse groups (such as groups from an Indigenous or culturally and linguistically diverse background, and young people with a disability).  Projects that show partnerships with other community organisations or local government authorities will also be looked on favourably.

 If you require further information about the National Youth Week Grants Program 2012 or assistance in completing an application form, please contact the appropriate State or Territory government department.
