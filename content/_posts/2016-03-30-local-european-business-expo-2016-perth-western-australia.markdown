_The Ukrainian Association of WA (UAWA) and the Australia Ukraine Chamber of Commerce (AUCC) are excited to announce that the Ukrainian Community will be participating in a first ever “Local European Business Expo 2016” in Perth, Western Australia.  The Expo will also include Polish & Hungarian Businesses._

_The Polish Ambassador, Mr Pawel Milewski, has already confirmed his attendance and will be coming to Perth specifically to welcome the participants and visitors to this extraordinary event._

We are currently working on inviting Ukrainian Ambassador Mr Mykola Kulinich to visit Perth in the time of this event, so that he could also welcome Ukrainian businesses and members of our Ukrainian Community who would be participating or visiting the Expo.

The European Business Expo 2016 will be held on Saturday, 03 September, in the premises of Sikorski Polish Club at 7 Bellevue Rd, Bellevue WA 6056.

Entry for visitors will be free and the participation cost for businesses will be $50 per table. The Business Expo Organisational Committee will endeavour to install portable walls between the tables, so each space will present as a separate individual space for each participating business. The spaces would have access to electricity.

_The Ukrainian Community can be represented by up to 15 businesses and places will be assigned on a first come-first served basis._

_At this stage, we are asking all Ukrainian businesses which would like to take part in European Business Expo 2016, to notify us about their intent to participate BEFORE the 30th of March so that we have a tentative list of participants before the next Business Expo Organisational Committee meeting._

_In order to secure your business’s representation at the very first Local European Business Expo 2016 in Perth, please contact Dmytro Legeyda (state representative of the AUCC) via email: [dl@aucc.biz](mailto:dl@aucc.biz), or mobile: [0431 316 923](tel:0431%20316%20923)._

_Kind regards,_
