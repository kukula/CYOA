	  * Marie Ficarra MLC, NSW Parliamentary Secretary to the Premier (Liberal)
	  * John Ajaka MLC, NSW Parliamentary Secretary for Transport & Roads (Liberal)
	  * Guy Zangari MP, NSW Shadow Minister for Communities and Citizenship (ALP)
	  * Hon. Philip Ruddock MP, Federal Member for Berowra (Liberal)

	  * Emmanuel Valageorgiou, President, Ethnic Communities Council

“The National Festival is an opportunity for our community to celebrate its settlement in this wonderful country and to share our heritage with our Australian friends, neighbours and workmates. That’s why it’s great to see so many outstanding people from the political and community leadership of NSW and Australia coming along.

“Our community was part of disbanding the White Australia Policy and building the successful multiculturalism that Australia now benefits from. So, we welcome them all, both old and new friends, and extend the hand of Aussie mateship – Ukrainian-style,” Mr Romaniw said.
