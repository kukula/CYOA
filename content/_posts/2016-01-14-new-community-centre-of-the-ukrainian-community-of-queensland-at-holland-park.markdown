Both Mr Pavlyshyn and Mr Chomyn are excited about the future of the Ukrainian Community in Queensland.

On 4 January 2016 the keys from the Lynndon Bowls Club were officially handed over from club secretary Mr Bruce Cocks to president of the Ukrainian Community of Queensland Inc. Mr Stephan Chomyn.

At the first management committee meeting in our new Ukrainian Community Centre, the members of the committee surprised the secretary of the Ukrainian Community of Queensland Inc, Ms Nataliya Murad, with a cake for her birthday.

We would like to wish our Nataliya the very best of health, much joy and happiness, not just only for that day, but for many years to come.

We'd like to thank her for her friendship and for helping our community.

We are very grateful to have her as a friend and a committee member. We thank her for her thoughtfulness, understanding and wisdom.

May God bless her and Mnohaya Lita!

From the "Uprava" of UCQ Inc."
