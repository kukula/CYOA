The AFUO today announces that OzUke2015 - the inaugural Australia-Ukraine bilateral relations forum - will take place on November 25 and 26 at the Rydges on Swanston in Melbourne, Victoria.




OzUke2015 is a collaboration between the AFUO and Centre UA, a leading pro-democracy NGO based in Kyiv. It also has the strong cooperation of the Australia-Ukraine Chamber of Commerce, and the support of both the Australian and Ukrainian Governments.








OzUke2015 is a key milestone in growing ties between Australia and Ukraine at the civil society level and at the business level.




A strong delegation of Ukrainian political, civic and business leaders is expected to come to Melbourne for OzUke2015.




“Now is the time to build greater ties between Ukrainian society and Australian society for the benefit of both. Our countries are geographically far away but we strongly share democratic values and the spirit of mateship. There are great potential synergies at the civil society, ethical business, sport, and cultural levels, but these aspects need to be actively cultivated, and we wish to do so with our excellent partners at Centre UA, who have have a great track-record in the democratisation process in Ukraine,” Stefan Romaniw OAM, AFUO President, said.
