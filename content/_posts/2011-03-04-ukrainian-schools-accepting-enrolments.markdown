**BENEFITS FROM LEARNING ANOTHER LANGUAGE**

Educational research proves that knowing two or more languages is a valuable skill for individuals and for the country. “At the beginning of the twenty-first century, proficiency in only one language is not enough for economic, societal, and educational success. Global interdependence and mass communication often require the ability to function in more than one language”. (Prof. Michael Clyne, eminent linguist and University of Melbourne Honorary Professorial Fellow)

Children who develop a high level of competence in at least one language in addition to English, will benefit culturally, cognitively, in communicative competence, and in many cases, in terms of understanding themselves and their families.

Benefits can be gained at any age.

**Enrol your child at a Ukrainian school** **in North Melbourne, Noble Park, Geelong, Sydney, Adelaide, Perth or Brisbane.**

Classes from Preschool to Year 10 or 12.

LOTE Ukrainian is a registered Yr 11 & 12 subject (VCE, HSC, SACE).

Adult classes available in North  Melbourne.

_Schools recognize that children may have varying levels of Ukrainian language ability and comprehension and successfully address the needs of children beginning to learn Ukrainian, as well as those with advanced knowledge.  We encourage language acquisition and appreciation of Ukrainian culture and heritage ** **in a caring, supportive and positive environment._
