AN UPDATE FROM THE AUSTRALIAN FEDERATION OF UKRAINIAN ORGANISATIONS ON THE CURRENT SITUATION IN UKRAINE




## Call to ACTION


The Australian Federation  of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) has been actively involved in  setting and supporting humanitarian   aid for Ukrainian Armed Forces and Volunteers in the form of battle first aid training,  first aid packs and other equipment . In the current tension and climate this area of support has been acknowledged as area of need by officials in Ukraine. We met with senior Ukrainian Government officials – PM, Deputy PM, Head of Ukraine’s  Security Council ,senior officials at the Ministry of Defence who all endorsed the program.

Here is an example of what support is being provided -[

The Ukrainian  World Congress (UWC)  has Dr Ulana Suprun on the ground and with her husband Marko have been instrumental in the program and are our eyes and ears directly on the ground. They have been the pillar of the program and the AFUO acknowledges their major work and personal substantial financial contribution . _Action not words ! _She is seen in this video.

As reported recently  I visited the training base of the volunteers and reserves and those  who are managing the distribution of funds sent from Australia and other countries by purchasing equipment , training and advice

To date the AFUO  has sent  in excess of $100 000. We acknowledge and thank all who have responded so generously.

The AFUO reported at its AGM in late May on where monies have gone since December with all monies being accounted for. No funds have been used for administration  , airfares etc. All travel costs of AFUO executive members have been covered by individual members.

The AFUO and UWC have taken a very much centralised coordinated approach to collecting and distributing funds . We can try and do many little things or concentrate on one major project . We have  opted for a focussed and effective project.

The AFUO has been worked closely with the Australian Government  – the Prime Minister’s Office , the Minster for Foreign Affairs and DFAT for many months and especially in recent days since that tragic MH 17 criminal act.

The AFUO also maintained  that Putin has to be stopped . The bigger the footprint in Ukraine the more danger  internationally. The AFUO has for some time  called on the Australian Government to seriously consider  banning Putin and his representatives  from  the G20 Forum in Brisance in November. We acknowledge the position of the Australian Government  via the PM, Julie Bishop, the Qld Premier , the leader of the Federal   Opposition   in relation to  Russia’s  G20 participation

The AFUO have also sent a message to our Ambassador Jean Dunn and DFAT supporting  and acknowledging  their efforts .

In recent days there have been memorials organised by AFUO members in  most  States. AFUO Executives  given numerous  interviews in past days.– These messages have been coordinated

I will be presenting information on our work  at a Public Meeting in Sydney on August 10. Similar meetings will be held in some of other States as requests are received .

Australia has been strong in the UN Security Council in  having its voice heard internationally The death of 28 Australians has hit Australians hard .

We approached our international affiliates via the UWC to lobby their representatives. The Australian Government  called  for an international investigation and will accept nothing else.

The Australian Govt has lead the world on this issue . It must be noted that the PM  Tony Abbott, Minister Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop  supported by the Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten  have shown the difference between real politics and diplomacy – not mincing words , calling a spade a spade .  Tony Abbott and Julie Bishop need to be congratulated for their strong, principled position.

Take note that others have now followed suit. The lexicon is hardening – e.g. yesterday’s  position presented by the US rep to UN Security Council.

One further possible channel of pressure is increasing the sanctions including targeting the funders, rich oligarchs freezing of their assets , investigation  of where assets were obtained and then freezing these assets if found to be ‘dirty money’,  expulsion of Russian Federation diplomats , withdrawal of diplomats from Russia.

This is crunch time in international relations and creating a balanced new order in the world .

The   AFUO calls on the community  to continue supporting U-HELP project .

We will not be distracted by secondary issues , but will continue to be  focused

## **U-HELP: YOUR CHANCE TO HELP UKRAINE**


**U-HELP** (the _Ukrainian Humanitarian Educational and Leadership Program_) is announced by the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) as the endorsed way for Australians to support Ukraine’s sovereignty, democracy and path to peace and prosperity.

The objectives of **U-HELP**, an official initiative of the AFUO, are:



	  * * To fund humanitarian and medical assistance for people injured in the self-defence of Ukraine, and;
	  * * To support educational and leadership initiatives that promote Ukraine’s democratisation and prosperity through increased Ukraine-Australia social, political and economic ties.

Mr. Stefan Romaniw OAM, President of the peak body for Ukrainian Australians, said:


<blockquote>AFUO has heard Ukraine’s request for help. And, we have heard that Ukrainian Australians, as well as members of the general Australian public, want the chance to individually help Ukraine in this period of both challenge and opportunity.

AFUO has undertaken wide consultation with the Ukrainian World Congress, including its Ukraine-based Humanitarian Director Dr Ulana Suprun, the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, the new democratic Government of Ukraine, including the Ministry for Defence, Ukrainian-based reform NGO leaders, and charitable workers.

**U-HELP** is therefore founded as the AFUO-approved, targeted and accountable way to practically and materially help Ukraine – both now and going forward. **U-HELP** is both about meeting **urgent humanitarian needs** in Ukraine, and building a **better independent and democratic future** for Ukraine.

**U-HELP** will address the consequences of violence being inflicted on Ukraine’s citizens. It will also give emerging leaders greater understanding of democratic and business institutions, such as the very successful ones we have here in Australia.

Despite the current foreign aggression, we are very optimistic about Ukraine’s future including on-going democratic reform, Euro-integration, and greater prosperity through economic liberalization and transparency. But, the past teaches us that we must work and invest to achieve those improved results for the people of Ukraine.

To that end, many in Ukraine look at Australia as an ideal example of what is possible in a successful society; many in Australia see the benefits that a democratic and prosperous Ukraine will bring, including to Australian business. Through **U-HELP**, we can act to harness all that good will,</blockquote>


**U-HELP** will be rolled out in successive phases over the next 12 months. In Phase 1, whose implementation in Ukraine will be coordinated by Dr Suprun, the emphasis will be on humanitarian support for those harmed while defending Ukraine. This will primarily include:



	  1. funding first aid training for Ukrainian service personnel and providing them with the appropriate medical and related equipment;
	  2. training medical professionals to treat combat-related injuries, and;
	  3. providing assistance to the families of those who perished during the Maidan movement, such as the Heavenly Hundred.

A tri-lingual video on such training is available at: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_pl12HIejU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_pl12HIejU)

In Phase 2, **U-HELP’s** emphasis will be on building links through the AFUO between Ukraine and Australia to build up Ukraine’s democratic and business institutions, especially by working with the next generation of leaders. This will include:

a) a high-level bilateral relations conference in both Kyiv and Australia;

b) trade delegations;

c) leadership development and training, and;

d) information provision in coordination with the Government of Ukraine.

**U-HELP** will be fully administered by the Board of the AFUO and legally compliant with all auditing procedures. Regular reports will be publicly provided by the Board of the AFUO on all funds raised and their expenditure.

**U-HELP** donations can be made by **EFT** (Electronic Funds Transfer) to:
