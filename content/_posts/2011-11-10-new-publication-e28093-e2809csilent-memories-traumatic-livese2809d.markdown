_Silent Memories - Traumatic Lives_ is the result of a study undertaken during her doctoral research by Dr Lesa Melnyczuk Morgan, Associate Researcher at the Maritime History department of the WA Maritime Museum in Fremantle, Western Australia.

It is a history of those Ukrainians who came to settle in Western Australia between 1947 and 1951, from the Displaced Persons camps of Europe.

The work is due to be published March 2012, but a special pre-publication offer is available (offer ends February 2012).
