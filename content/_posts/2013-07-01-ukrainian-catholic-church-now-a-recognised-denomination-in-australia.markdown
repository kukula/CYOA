### Governor-General proclaims Ukrainian Catholic Church in Australia a recognised denomination.


Since its inception over 50 years ago, the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Eparchy in Australia has been regarded by the Commonwealth government as a part of the Roman Catholic Church for the purposes of registration as a religious entity.  Such registration brings with it certain authority and responsibilities, and particularly the power to nominate ministers of religion as authorised marriage celebrants.

As a result of the work of Bishop Peter Stasiuk and the assistance of the Bishop’s Conference of Australia, on 13 June 2013, the Governor-General of Australia has proclaimed the Ukrainian Catholic Church in Australia as a recognised denomination under section 26 of the Marriage Act 1961.  This long overdue step reflects the level of autonomy which the Ukrainian Catholic Church enjoys as an Eparchy in Australia.
