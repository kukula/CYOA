USC took out the 2014 Maribyrnong Volleyball Championships in the Open Men's division, on Sunday the 15th of June, held at the Maribyrnong Sports Academy. Topping their group and cruising through the cross over, the USC boys played a great brand of volleyball. However, the grand final proved to be a greater test against BLASH.

Dropping the first set 25-18, USC pulled it together in the second set to take it 25-17. Up 8-6 at the change over on the third and final set, USC ended up taking it out 15 - 12.

With a combined age of over 300 years in this team, they played like young chickens again. As a spectator stated, alot of them would probably struggle to walk the next day, but that's a small price to pay for a great result like that. A fantastic team effort was shown by everyone and everyone should be proud.

Currently celebrating their 30yr anniversary, USC Lions is one of Australia's oldest running Ukrainian-Australian sporting clubs. The AFUO congratulates the boys on the tournament victory and reaching 30yrs. Mnohaja Lita! USC LION play in the western region volleyball competition every Friday night at Maribyrnong secondary college.
