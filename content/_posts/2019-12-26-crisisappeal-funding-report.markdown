The is the first stage funding report from the Ukraine Crisis Appeal committee. [You can read the whole report by clicking here. This report includes detail about the Ukrainians who were helped.](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UKRAINE-CRISIS-APPEAL-REPORT-1.pdf)


### _Background for the first stage of funding: _


In 2018, $128,000 AUD was raised by the fund. This enabled the Veteran Program to support 25 Veterans and their families (approximately 100 people) on the journey for a better life. With the aim of a holistic care program, an in depth assessment was completed by Caritas Ukraine qualified case workers to identify each of the Veterans specific needs. These_ otherwise would not have been fulfilled _due to financial circumstances, ineligibility for support from the state, as well as the lack of specialised treatment in their cities or villages.


### _What types of care were provided? _

Once satisfied, they advise AFUO & recommend RAWCS release funds to **CARITAS UKRAINE** who implement the program / or pass on financial support to the nominated program.
