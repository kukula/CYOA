## PROTEST IN SYDNEY




### Monday 3rd March 2014 at 6:15 pm




### Russian Consulate Sydney,




### 5-7 Fullerton Street, Woollahra


All Australians concerned about Vladimir Putin's neo-imperial military intervention in Ukraine should show their concern and let their voices be heard. 

Media will be alerted. 

Bring Australian flags in particular, Ukrainian flags, and signs/banners condemning Putin's actions and calling for international solution....

Remember: we protest against Putin. Â Russians in Ukraine have supported the Maidan Movement and Russians in Russia want the democratic reform that they have witnessed in Kyiv.

This rally is under the auspices of the [Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Australian-Federation-of-Ukrainian-Organisations/79542805667)/ [Ukrainian Council of NSW](https://www.facebook.com/UkrainianCouncilOfNSW) Pro-Maidan Committee in Sydney.


For more information, contact Wasyl Senko, Deputy Chair, on 0431 030 164.
