### MH 17  2nd ANNIVERSARY OF THIS DISASTER – STILL NO ANSWERS




### WE MUST NOT ALLOW IT TO FALL OFF THE RADAR


The Australian Ukraine community continues to mourn the 38 Australians who were murdered over Ukraine on July 17, 2014, when flight MH17 was shot down by Russian forces.

The families of the dead still grieve – and still have no answers.

No one has taken responsibility for the act of international terrorism. But neither does anybody doubt who is to blame.

The rebels who brought down Malaysian Airlines MH17 were sponsored and equipped by Moscow as part of Russia’s brutal and illegal annexation of Crimea.

There were 298 people on board the Boeing 777 which was flying at 32,000 feet over the village of Snizhne when it was brought down by a Russian-built Buk surface-to-air missile launcher which had been smuggled across the border.

No one survived.

The missile launcher was just one weapon in a range of heavy artillery supplied to the rebels from Moscow.

The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations awaits the findings of the official Netherlands investigation of the tragedy – Russia is not cooperating with Dutch prosecutors – and continues to call for an international tribunal to deal with perpetrators.

“Two years on Russian aggression in Ukraine continues, and Russian President Vladimir Putin flaunts the Minsk Agreements and UN Resolution 68/262 that affirmed Crimea is part of Ukraine.” Stefan Romaniw OAM Chairman of AFUO said.

“July 17 is a time to remind the Australian Government and other world leaders of Russia’s bloody seizure of Crimea.

It is also the time for the civilised world to agree on strong sanctions against Mr Putin and to mobilise peace-keeping forces to protect Ukrainians from Russia’s illegal expansion.” Mr Romaniw said.

The AFUO extends its sympathy to the families of those murdered on that horrific day and calls on Australian Government to continue to show support for Ukraine.

Requiem services will be held in Ukrainian churches throughout Australia on Sunday July 17, 2016 to pray for those who lost their lives on MH17.
