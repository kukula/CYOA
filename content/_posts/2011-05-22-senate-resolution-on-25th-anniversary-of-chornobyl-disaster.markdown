The resolution  noted a number of  important factors impacting the international community and Ukraine, including:




- Relevant heavy social and economic impacts on the population and areas affected by the Chornobyl disaster;




- Shut down by Ukraine (in 1991, 1996 and 2000) of the three remaining reactors at the Chornobyl site and construction of the confinement over reactor number four which urgently requires replacement;




- Great importance of the nuclear power for the national power industry of Ukraine and its functioning according to the internationally agreed nuclear safety standards of the International Atomic Energy Agency;




- The importance of nuclear safety.




The resolution was initiated by the Senator Catryna Bilyk, Head of the Australia – Ukraine Parliamentary Group of the Australian Parliament.




 




On April 19, 2011 the Australian Government was represented by His Excellency Ambassador Michael Potts at  the Kyiv Summit on Safe and Innovative Use of Nuclear Energy.
