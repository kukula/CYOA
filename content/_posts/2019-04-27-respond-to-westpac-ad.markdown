The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations  (AFUO) calls on members of the Ukrainian community and the broader Australian community to strongly protest the Westpac advertisement in today's Melbourne Herald Sun & Sydney Daily Telegraph promoting their  Westpac Fraud Money Back Guarantee Policy and putting the focus on UKRAINE.____




__ __Issues of fraud and  misuse of credit cards is an international phenomenon. ______There is no need to isolate Ukraine.____




__ __If it was intended as a marketing ploy - it is in bad taste and derogatory.____




__ __The AFUO calls on Westpac to apologise and undertake this advertisement will be removed from any further campaign.____




__ __The AFUO suggests members who bank with Westpac to demand action and an apology. Those who don’t bank with Westpac contact the back and protest also.
