The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO), the peak body for Ukrainians in Australia, expresses its sympathy and support to all affected by the current horrific bushfires in Australia.

Our deepest gratitude goes to all who are fighting these fires and to the many hundreds of volunteers assisting.

To show support and reinforce that the Ukrainian community is an integral part of the Australian community, the AFUO has launched a fundraising campaign, _Kolyada for Australia (Carols for Australia)._

As the Ukrainian community prepares for the Julian calendar Christmas period, which starts on January 6 with Christmas Eve, the campaign will focus on raising funds over the next 100 hours in the lead up to Christmas Day, a time of giving.

The AFUO has kick-started the campaign with a $1000 pledge.

“We need to act swiftly to ensure that those in need are supported. Australia is burning.” Stefan Romaniw OAM, Co-Chair of the AFUO said.

In the Ukrainian tradition, carollers visit homes singing carols and collect for various causes. This year, the call to action is for community organisations and individuals to donate to the AFUO Kolyada for Australia cause.

Funds raised will be passed on to the Red Cross, a major mainstream organisation responsible for national relief.

The Ukrainian community has always been generous and acted decisively when help is needed. This year make Ukrainian Christmas more meaningful by helping others.

The AFUO also calls on all churches to include in their prayers of the faithful references those who are enduring this great tragedy, those who have lost their lives and those who are defending and fighting the fires.
