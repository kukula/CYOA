**Members of the Delegation:**

Professor Iurii Shapoval is Head of the I. F. Kuras Institute of Political and Ethno-National Research, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, and the author, co-author and editor of numerous books and collections of documents, many of them concerned with the crimes of Stalin’s regime.

Ms Agnieszka Rudzińska is the Vice-President of the Institute of National Remembrance, Poland. Ms Rudzinska will present the volumes of the series “Poland and Ukraine in the 1930s and 1940s” to the University Librarian, Ms Cathrine Harboe Ree.

Mr Marcin Majewski is Head of the Department of Archival Research and Publication of Sources, Institute of National Remembrance (IPN), Poland.

Dr Rafał Leśkiewicz is Director of the Office of Document Accessibility and Archiving, IPN.

The publication series “Poland and Ukraine in the 1930s and 1940s” is the outcome of an important international collaborative research project involving historians and other scholars from Poland and Ukraine. Eight volumes have appeared so far, as well as the English-language book _Holodomor. The Great Famine in Ukraine 1932-1933_.

The books of the series use and present previously unpublished documents from numerous archives, including the National Archives of the Ukrainian Security Service, the State Archives of Ukraine and, in Poland, the Central Military Archives (CAW) and the Archive of New Acts (AAN).

The co-operation of Polish and Ukrainian scholars working in previously sealed archives establishes grounds for new insights into the traumatic and often controversial history of the relatively recent past. It is also exemplary of the potential role of scholarship in promoting international understanding and respect.
