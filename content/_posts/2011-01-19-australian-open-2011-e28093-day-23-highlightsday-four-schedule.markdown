**AUSTRALIAN OPEN 2011 – **




**DAY 2/3 HIGHLIGHTS/DAY FOUR SCHEDULE
**




**“DAY TWO – 3 out of 4 aint bad!”**


Bondarenko opened DAY TWO, against 54th ranked Chinese Shuai Peng. After a promising start, it turned into a tight 3-set battle, ending in Peng’s favour 2-6, 6-3, 8-6. Kateryna’s Open is far from over however, seeing her team up with Safina for the Women’s doubles later in the week.

Next up was Alexandr Dolgopolov, who blitzed his Kazakhstani opponent in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4. Alexandr’s 2nd Round appearance should therefore be staged for sometime on Thursday. Stay tuned for the exact schedule.

Lesya Tsurenko also managed to Schnyde off any nervous openings, annihilating 44th ranked Patty Schnyder in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3.

With a small Ukrainian supporters group in toe, Illya Marchenko wrapped up a successfull day,  sending Spaniard, Ruben Ramirez Hidalgo, home in 3 sets, 6-3, 6-4, 6-1.


**“DAY THREE – The Ukrainian onslaught continues!”**


Once again, Sergiy Stakhovsky came out firing this morning, again proceeding through in straight sets 6-3, 6-4, 6-4. We will see him back in action some time on Friday.
