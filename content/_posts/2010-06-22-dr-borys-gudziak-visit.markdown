](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/borys_gudziak.jpg)I am sure that by now you have all heard of the forthcoming visit to Australia by the Rector of the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv, [Rev. Dr Borys Gudziak](http://ucu.edu.ua/eng/about/administration/fr-borys-gudziak/) whose firm and instant reaction to attempts of the SBU (acting for the new regime) to intimidate him and threaten criminal action against the University students who participate in any form of anti government demonstrations, has reverberated through serious media around the world. This shows what ONE MAN with a backbone and love for God and Ukraine can achieve.

CYOA through my direct involvement and with the cooperation with Bishop Peter Stasiuk will have the opportunity to meet with and exchange views on the situation in Ukraine today. I will send a program of the Visit to all CYOA members.

The chair of CYOA, Stefan Romaniw, through his positions with OUN and SKU as well as his frequent visits to Ukraine will ensure we CYOA Australia will be kept abreast of issues requiring action in Australia and the Diaspora. It is my aim that we, that is all CYOA members bodies are in the position to assist as the situation requires.

We need to improve and develop new Key parliamentary contacts, and those in Academia and ensure that they are kept informed of the developments in Ukraine .

It is important that we reactivate the Ukrainian Australian Parliamentary association.

We should ensure that we include youth in all of our internal and external conferences.

It is necessary that each Hromada has a “Zovnishni Zvjazke” referentura and that we arrange joint meetings to discuss our needs and future activities from a state and National perspective. IF we ACT together, we will be the victors, if we sit on our hands we will be the victims. The choicer is ours to make.
