‘_One of the best comedians in Australia’_ (**Gold 104.3**), **Danny McGinlay** has done lots to impress girls in the past, and he’s ready to share the story of his biggest relationship challenge yet as he demonstrates exactly how far he was willing to go for a chick in Kiev.

As Danny prepared to marry his Ukrainian girlfriend, to prove his worthiness to her and her family he enrolled in night school and had six months to learn a completely new 33-letter alphabet, master the concept of hard and soft vowels and adapt to a language made up of sounds most people can’t hear.

As seen on Rove, The Project, The Footy Show, Adam Hills Tonight and the best comedy venues in Australia, McGinlay’s fresh, honest humour has audiences in fits of laughter as they relate not so much to his own ludicrous experiences, but to his knack for finding himself in ridiculous situations.

Did he succeed in wrapping his tongue around a completely new language, and winning the hearts of his new family?
