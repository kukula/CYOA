### AFUO CHAIRMAN'S UKRAINE VISIT UPDATE 14-20 MARCH 2016


I am currently in Kyiv for a working week of meetings. As part of Ukrainian  World Congress (UWC) Delegation we have had a series of meetings as outlined below.

Issues raised are also listed in point form  below.

Currently the issue of Ukraine’s political leadership is at the forefront. It is anticipated that there will be a change of PM on one hand, yet others are taking the line that there is stability and no need for change. There are many meetings being held by political parties and factions.

The important thing is that this matter must be solved and indications are that it will be resolved in the next 10 days - 14 days.

The issue of Russian aggression, propaganda and demands of the Minsk accords and  Russian noncompliance , fighting corruption, the Papal meeting with Patriarch Kyril have all been central to our  discussions.

The need for Ukraine to project far more positive image to highlight WHAT IS BEING DONE has also been the topic of discussion. Those living in Ukraine, Foreign Governments and international media need to have this information on a regular basis.

All whom we have met are very grateful to Ukrainian Diaspora for the work being undertaken by the UWC and in our case AFUO.

The President of Ukraine paid special tribute to Australia and thanked the Government and the community for its efforts.

Former PM Tony Abbott is flying in later this week for meetings the Advisory Council convened by President Poroshenko.

There is a meeting with Tony Abbott scheduled on Saturday to provide him an AFUO brief on issues in Ukraine and Australia Ukraine issues.

I will provide a more full report on my return.
