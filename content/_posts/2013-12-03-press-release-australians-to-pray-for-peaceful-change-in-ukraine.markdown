An inter-faith prayer vigil for peace and positive change in Ukraine will be held on Wednesday, December 4th at 12.45pm at Martin Place in Sydney’s CBD.

 The prayer vigil is to feature: 

> 
> 
	  * Clergy and representatives from the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox, Ukrainian Catholic, Roman Catholic, Jewish and Muslim faiths in religious garments;
	  * An eyewitness report of recent Kyiv pro-democracy demonstrations, and;
	  * Candle-lighting, Ukrainian religious icons, and traditional Ukrainian embroidered dress.

 Prayer vigil organiser, Pete Shmigel of the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations, said: 

_“As Australians of various backgrounds, we join together in prayer for and solidarity with peaceful protestors in Ukraine.__ _

_“As President Yanukovych sends security forces and provocateurs against peaceful protestors, we pray for the safety of the people of Ukraine, and for peaceful and positive change. They deserve what we are fortunate to have in Australia: sovereignty, democracy, prosperity and basic freedoms._

_ __“We hope that the Australian Government will therefore publicly condemn State-sanctioned violence and give its support to peaceful and positive change in Ukraine, as Canada, the United States, the European Community and other allies have done.”_</blockquote>
