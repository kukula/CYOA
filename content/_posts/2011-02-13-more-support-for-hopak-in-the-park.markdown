**Hopak in the Park - Ukrainian Cossack Dance Spectacular**


MELBOURNE will spring into action in spectacular style when an army of Ukrainian Cossack dancers hit the Sidney Myer Music Bowl on April 30, 2011 from 1.00pm to 6.00pm.

 Witness a cast of more than 300 Ukrainian dancers from across Australia kick up a storm as they showcase centuries of dazzling dance moves in the outdoor extravaganza _Hopak In the Park_.

 Featuring Australia's best Ukrainian dance ensembles and musical acts - including the _Cossack Brothers, Iskra, Roztiazhka, Verchovyna, Veselka, Volya, Yevshan and Zahrava_ -  the inaugural Ukrainian Dance Festival promises to captivate Melbourne audiences with an afternoon feast of high-flying kicks, breathtaking spins and jaw-dropping leaps.

 Special guest band _Hrim_ from New York and popular young music talent _S.o.V_ also join a local line-up for a fusion of traditional Ukrainian tunes and funky beats.

Adding his support to the event is the State Minister for Multicultural Affairs and Citizenship, The Hon. Nicholas Kotsiras, MP.
