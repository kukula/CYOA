Melbourne Ukrainians are taking to the streets in protest against the Yanukovych regime and demanding support form the Australian Government

To show solidarity and support for Ukrainians in Kyiv and across Ukraine, the meeting will gather at the Treasury Gardens to march down to Collins Street to the City Square to pray for peace and end to violence.

A rally will then be held at the City Square with speakers and a prayer vigil.
