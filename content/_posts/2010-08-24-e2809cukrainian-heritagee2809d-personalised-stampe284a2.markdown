](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ucs-logo.jpg)The Ukrainian Collectibles Society (UCS) of Australia announces the release of a world first “Ukrainian Heritage” Personalised Stamp™ and souvenir first day of issue envelope series from the 4th quarter of 2010.

The “Ukrainian Heritage” series of stamps and covers is designed to provide a tangible philatelic record of the history of Ukrainian organisations established and operating in Australia since 1948, recognising and commemorating their status and respective unique contributions to Australia’s Ukrainian and wider communities. These achievements are to be promoted both within Australia and internationally. The project is expected to run over 3-4 years and will promote and acknowledge Ukrainian organisations from all states and territories of Australia.

The UCS is Australia’s only organisation solely dedicated to the collecting and promotion of Ukrainian collectibles, Ukrainica. Formed in 1994 the UCS and its members are major contributors to Ukrainian theme philately and collectibles in Australia and around the world.

The “Ukrainian Heritage” series will comprise an official Australia Post Personalised Stamp™ together with a first day of issue souvenir commemorative envelope. The label attached to the stamp will depict an Australian Ukrainian organisations’ logo while the envelope will reproduce the logo on the front and have descriptive text, in both English and Ukrainian, on the reverse.

The first two releases are scheduled for the 4th quarter of 2010. Issue number 1 will be dedicated to the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) with the second to the Ukrainian Youth Association SUM to coincide with their 60th anniversary of formation in Australia.

Releases will be limited to orders received from interested persons around the world and will not be repeated. Receipt of orders after the cut-off date cannot be fulfilled.
