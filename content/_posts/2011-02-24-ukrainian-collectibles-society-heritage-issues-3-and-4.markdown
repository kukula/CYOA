The Ukrainian Collectibles Society (UCS) has two new issues of its Ukrainian Heritage Series.

The Ukrainian Heritage Personalised Stamp and souvenir envelope series is designed to provide a tangible and collectible philatelic record of the history of various Ukrainian organisations in Australia since 1948, recognising and commemorating their respective unique contributions to Australia’s Ukrainian and wider communities.
