The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) has become a GOLD PATRON of the Ukraine Crisis Appeal donating $5000 to the Appeal. The appeal is coinciding with Team Ukraine who will be participating in the Invictus Games in Sydney on October 20-28, 2018____




__ __This funding is to support rehabilitation of ATO Veterans and their families. Caritas Ukraine in consultation with the AFUO will identity projects in Ukraine delivering much needed rehabilitation to our veterans who have been fighting Russian aggression in Eastern Ukraine.____

“No one want to go to war. No one wants to be an ATO veteran who has lost a limb or is suffering Post Traumatic Stress. No family wants to become unstable because of returned veterans of the ATO. But life deals a range of cards – not always the one we want". Mr Romaniw said. ____




__ __“Our veterans are fighting a war against Russian aggression. They were and continue to be ready to give all even their lives or their future livelihood” Mr Romaniw said____




__ __“Our financial contribution of $5000 maybe but a drop in the ocean of what is needed. However collectively if we all chip in, the drop becomes a river, then becomes the ocean and provides much needed, effective support” Mr Romaniw said____




__ __The AFUO calls on our organisations and members of the community to step up to the plate and contribute - [www.ukrainiancrisisappeal.org](http://www.ukrainiancrisisappeal.org/)  . Your contribution is tax deductible____




__ __“Our committee is grateful that the AFUO is leading by example and has become a Gold Patron. This will hopefully encourage others to follow suit”, Chair of the AFUO Invictus Games Support Committee Darka Senko said.____
