### AUSTRALIA’S UKRAINIAN COMMUNITY CALL TO ACTION #FreeSavchenko


The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations urges the international community, including human rights organisations and women’s organisations to demand the immediate release by Russian authorities of former Ukrainian Air Force pilot, Member of Ukrainian Parliament and delegate to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Lieutenant Nadiya Savchenko, who remains imprisoned for political considerations.

The AFUO has called on the Prime Minister of Australia to make representation to PM Putin and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make representation to the Embassy of the Russian Federation on Canberra demanding Savchenko’s immediate release and condemn this act of violation of human rights.

The AFUO has also written to the following seeking their support;



	  * The Hon Philip Ruddock, Australia’s envoy on human rights (Elect)
	  * The Hon Bill Shorten, Leader of the Federal Opposition
	  * Amnesty International Australian
	  * National Council of Women of Australia
	  * Australian Women Pilots’ Association

seeking their support.

The AFUO calls on the Ukrainian Community in Australia to join the international campaign on **March 9 2016** to highlight this travesty of injustice.

What can you do?

	  * Contact your local Member of Parliament. Request they support the AFUO’s calls to action to PM and Minister of Foreign affairs, demanding Savchenko’s release.
	  * Organise local events such as demonstrations, marches, vigils or meetings in community centres or even private homes.
	  * Send articles to local newspapers; issue a media advisory, publicise your event on social media.
	  * Send messages of support to Nadiya, upload photos and reports about your event to the Nadiya Savchenko Facebook page _(_[https://www.facebook.com/nadiyasavchenko1](https://www.facebook.com/nadiyasavchenko1)_)_

Recently the AFUO initiated the Australian–Ukrainian community’s involvement in the #UnitedUkraine campaign. Australia had the largest representation across the international campaign.

The AFUO calls on the community to again stand up and act!

**Background **

The prosecution by Russian authorities of Nadiya Savchenko, kidnapped in Ukraine and forcibly transported across the border into the Russian Federation, is in clear violation of international law and clause 5 of the _Minsk Protocol_ of 5 September 2014.

In addition to the limited access to legal representation and court proceedings, Nadiya Savchenko was subjected to a forensic psychiatric evaluation against her will.

Despite the fact that the international community has unequivocally denounced the actions of the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine as those of a foreign aggressor, Russian authorities continue to brazenly contravene their international commitments by violating the sovereignty of Ukraine.
