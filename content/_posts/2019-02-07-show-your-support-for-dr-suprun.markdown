The Administrative Court in Kyiv issued a ruling endeavouring to ban Ukraine's acting health minister Dr. Ulana Suprun from performing her Ministerial functions.










This is an outrageous and politically motivated act - against an individual who has done nothing but positive actions for Ukraine's reforms in Health care.
See our letter to Ambassador Melissa O'Rourke below.



 	  *  A working group has been formed on the issue
 	  * This group has secured President, PM and many others to  support (when up until Friday little interest)
 	  * Many Governments have taken a watchful position
 	  * We have sparked the international social  media campaign and activity in a range of countries
 	  * A quick decision made after seeing support to put her up for vote in VR
 	  * A fraction headed via Andreij Levus MP have now posted on agenda for VR

You can show your support on social media for Dr Ulana Suprun by using the hashtag #SupportSuprun and sharing posts like:







This ruling is an outrage! I support Dr Ulana and her work for a positive future in Ukraine. #supportsuprun.
