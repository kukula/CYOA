**Examples of AFUO activity in the past 3 years:

 	  * Played a significant role in programing the visit of President Poroshenko to Australia in December 2014
 	  * Lobbied for the opening of an Embassy of Australia in Kyiv, Ukraine

 	  * Participated in meetings with President Poroshenko, PM, Minister for Foreign Affairs and other Ministers to promote Australia-Ukraine relations
 	  * Facilitated the opportunity for Textor-Crosby to undertake a project with the Administration of the President of Ukraine
 	  * Instrumental in the formation of systemic combat first aid training program, Patriot Defence, in which over 30,000 soldiers and volunteers have now been trained and received NATO accredited first aid kits for battle. In due course, the program will become a systemic Government program, www.patriotdefence.org
 	  * Instrumental in lobbying DFAT to provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine as well as funding and support for Ukraine’s New Police program
 	  * Worked to reactivate the Australian Ukraine Parliamentary Friendship Group (AUPFG) and to facilitate discussion between it and the Ukraine–Australia Parliamentary Friendship Group

 	  * Initiated the formation of the Australia–Ukraine Chamber of Commerce and held the first Bilateral Business Forum in Melbourne in November 2015 with participation of business representatives from Australia and Ukraine
 	  * Working on the second Bilateral Business Forum in Kyiv, Ukraine in late 2016

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

**The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations via this Standing Committee calls on the Australian Government to: **



 	  * Continue building strategic alliances with Ukraine. Both countries aspire to a strong value system, have strong economic potential and have opportunities to enter into new markets.
 	  * Continue its support for Ukraine in fighting Russian aggression and the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation.
 	  * Continue with ongoing sanctions, against the Russian Federation and commit to strengthening these sanctions.
 	  * Assist in the training of members and leaders of Ukraine’s armed forces and volunteers.
 	  * Provide Ukraine with lethal weaponry.
 	  * Call on the international community to install international peacekeeping troops on the border.
 	  * Ensure that the Embassy of Australia in Kyiv remains open and appoint a new Ambassador to the post. Any concept of closing the post in Kyiv would be seen as a victory for President Putin and his administration. Australia has invested too much in recent years to allow this to happen.
 	  * Work in partnership with Ukraine in the UN Security Council.
 	  * Demand the release of political prisoners including Nadija Savchenko and 27 others.
 	  * Condemn President Putin and his administration for not adhering to the Minsk Accords.
 	  * Condemn the Russian Federation’s tactics in violating human and national rights.
 	  * Actively support the second Australia–Ukraine Business Forum in Kyiv in late 2016.
