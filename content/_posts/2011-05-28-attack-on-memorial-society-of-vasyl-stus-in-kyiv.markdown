Over the past few weeks there has been another human rights scandal in Ukraine - an attack on the Memorial Society of Vasyl Stus which is a historical museum.  A letter of complaint was lodged with authorities by a woman who has been a missing person for over two years and still cannot be found.  This again is a blatant attack by authorities in the old Stalinist style - make up the facts and don't let the truth get in the way.

The AFUO is writing to Minister Rudd and others on this issue

Read a translated piece from Roman Krutsyk, the Director of the Museum here:  [5 Memorial Society statement re krutsyk Engl](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/5-Memorial-Society-statement-re-krutsyk-Engl.pdf)
