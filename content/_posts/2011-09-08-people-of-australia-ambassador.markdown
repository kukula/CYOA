Nominations now open to be a People of Australia Ambassador


 Culturally and linguistically diverse individuals and communities are invited to nominate a person or themselves to be considered as a People of Australia Ambassador.

 As part of Australia’s new multicultural policy, up to 40 people will be selected as ambassadors for a 12-month period to provide ‘grass roots’ advice to the Australian Multicultural Council (AMC) about effective initiatives that promote inclusion and leverage diversity in our communities.

 Nominees must demonstrate a strong commitment to inclusion and social cohesion or may have involvement in a diverse range of community work and programs that strengthen neighbourhoods and unite all Australians.

Nominations close at 5.00pm, Friday 7 October 2011.

More information on the program and how to nominate can be found under the ‘People of Australia Ambassadors Program’ section of the AMC website at [http://www.amc.gov.au/](http://www.amc.gov.au/).
