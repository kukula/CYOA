### AUSTRALIA’S UKRAINIAN COMMUNITY PAYS TO RESPECT TO OUR ANZAC WAR VETERANS


Australia’s Ukrainian community pays its respect and expresses its gratitude to all our Australian War Veterans who have served in the armed forces and continue to serve to protect Australia and ensure our security.

On this ANZAC DAY we especially note the commitment and dedication of our Vietnam War Veterans’ as we commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan.

Australia continues to generate a new generation of veterans, those serving in the armed forces throughout the places of war and tension in the world today.

A soldier gives all to fight for values and beliefs – The many stories of protecting our country, protecting my mate, preparedness to give all. These stories should inspire us and encourage us never to take what we have for granted.

There are many stories of bravery in history some well documented and recognised and many we will never know about - such as the unknown soldier, who died in battle.

Australia has a history of protecting – Protecting not only Australian shores and land but protecting that of others, protecting a value system.

On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) pays tribute to members of the Ukrainian community who served in Vietnam. We also remember those from the Ukrainian community who died in Vietnam and other wars . May they rest in peace. Вічная пам’ять!

As Australian armed forces have also ways protected democratic processes and sovereignty, we also remember those in Ukraine today, fighting to protect the same values from Russian invasion and aggression.

LEST WE FORGET!
