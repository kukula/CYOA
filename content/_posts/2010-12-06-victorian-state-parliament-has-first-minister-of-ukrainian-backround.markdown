"The community has watched Matthew grow into a formidable and mature politician, who has strong values and a culture of being focused on outcomes and encouraging others to be part of this process Matthew has been accessible and supportive in Opposition not only to our community but to the broader community" Mr Romaniw said

"His commitment to the Ukrainian community in Australia and Victoria in particular should be noted. Mr Romaniw said
