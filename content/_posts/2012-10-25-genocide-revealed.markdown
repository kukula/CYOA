# **GENOCIDE REVEALED**


To mark the 80 year anniversary of the horrific events of the Holodomor (Genocide), Palace Kino Theatre in Melbourne will be screening the multi-award winning documentary - _GENOCIDE REVEALED_.

_GENOCIDE REVEALED_ (English version), winner of 12 International Film Awards, exposes Moscow’s policy of genocide against the Ukrainian nation.

The film focuses on the 1932-33 man-made famine in Soviet Ukraine and the accompanying decimation of the national elite. Millions of people were deliberately starved to death by Stalin’s regime.

The documentary is based on archival material, eye-witness accounts and commentaries by prominent historians, writers and researchers.

The film's award-winning producer/director/editor, Yurij Luhovy from Montreal, Canada, will be speaking about the documentary after the viewing.
