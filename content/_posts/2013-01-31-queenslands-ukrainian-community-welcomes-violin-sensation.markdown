](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Attilla-Sautov.jpg)Attilla Sautov, the renowned violinist, will be at the Ukrainian Community Centre in South Brisbane on Saturday 23 February 2013 at 3 p.m., for a performance with the Mueller International Chamber Orchestra and a beautiful new extremely versatile program, with supporting performances by talented local Ukrainian classical singers and musicians:



	  * Larrisa Brooker - Soprano
	  * Lyudmila Kelloway - Mezzo Soprano
	  * Iryna Penner - Piano, and
	  * Tomas Miljenovic - Clarinet.

Attilla started playing the Violin at the age of 4 in Tashkent.  His enormous talent and master classes with some of the world’s best violin players would soon allow him to win many international competitions.

In the year 2000 he moved to Germany where he worked as concert master in several leading Orchestras.  With them he did performances in the most prestigious venues all over the world like the Sydney Opera House, the Berlin Concert Hall, the Ottawa National Art Centre and the Hong Kong Art Centre.

He has become known for his extrovert and flamboyant stage presence and his tremendous command of the violin.  One of his favourite composers is Paganini and playing his very difficult parts always turns out to be a jaw dropping experience sending thrills and plucking pizzicatos down your spine.

Go and hear him play with the Mueller International Chamber Orchestra at the Ukrainian Community Centre, 70 Cordelia Street, South Brisbane and be transported, listening to some of the most powerful, impassioned and colourful music in the solo violin and voice repertoire.
