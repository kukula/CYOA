Thank you for your continued support of the US Agency for International Development’s Ukrainian Diaspora Investment Study.  **_The survey is ready!_**  Please show your love for Ukraine this week by taking and distributing the survey **FAR AND WIDE** throughout the Ukrainian diaspora community and encourage people to take the survey before March 7, 2016.

Please forward this email text to your network and feel free to cut and paste content onto social media. Please also connect to @lieslriddle on Twitter and Liesl Riddle on LinkedIn and retweet/repost announcements related to the study that you find there.  Note we are using the #FORUKRAINESURVEY in our posts.

**WHO IS CONDUCTING THIS SURVEY & WHY?**

USAID is seeking answers to the following questions: What if a private Ukrainian Diaspora Fund was created to invest capital for economic development in Ukraine?  Do you think this is a good idea?  A bad idea?  Why or why not?

**WHO SHOULD TAKE THE SURVEY?**

Anyone of Ukrainian descent should take the survey.  This includes individuals who were born in Ukraine – but it also means people born outside of Ukraine whose parents, grandparents, or great-grandparents were born in Ukraine.  Everyone’s opinion matters – whether they think that a Ukrainian Diaspora Fund is a good idea or not.

**WHY SHOULD THEY TAKE THE SURVEY?**

Every voice counts.  The more people that take the survey, the more reliable, useful and impactful the results will be.

**HOW CAN SOMEONE TAKE THE SURVEY?**

The survey is available through **_MARCH 7, 2016_**, and can be taken by clicking ONE of the links below (the same survey is available in three languages).
