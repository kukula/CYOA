### MEDIA RELEASE
Ukrainian arts festival twirls into Melbourne this weekend


A colourful festival of culture, dance and song will take over Melbourne’s Ukrainian precinct in Essendon and Melbourne Town Hall this weekend — Friday 7 to Sunday 9 July.

Sunday’s Gala Concert at the Melbourne Town Hall at 1.30pm will see over 300 performers from around Australia showcasing Ukrainian song and dance.

Every four years the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) organises a weekend of events for all to enjoy, showcasing Ukraine’s rich traditions and produce.

AFUO Chairman Stefan Romaniw said, “Although small in size relative to other ethnic groups, our Ukrainian community is regarded as one of Australia’s multicultural success stories.”

“As it is important to focus on the positives of community building, celebrating our rich culture and sharing it with the wider Australian community, we will also be remembering that the war continues to rage in eastern Ukraine due to Russian aggression. Our thoughts are with those who are on the front lines” he said.

Dancers, singers, musicians and writers from across the country will travel to Melbourne to perform in the festival over the three days.

This is the 15th festival of its kind. It falls on a special year as the Ukrainian diaspora launches a two-year program of national celebrations to mark 70 years of post WW2 settlement in Australia.

The festival opens this Friday with a welcome event at Ukrainian House in Essendon followed by literary readings, kids activities, a traditional market and ‘zabava’ (social dance) on Saturday, culminating in a gala concert at the Melbourne Town Hall on Sunday from 1.30pm.
