A pleasant autumnal day was on hand to welcome over 1,400 attendees to the Sidney Myer Music Bowl in Melbourne, Australia for the second Hopak in the Park on Saturday 28 April 2012.

Proceedings commenced with the singing of the National Anthems of Australia and Ukraine, followed by the Welcome _(Pryvit) _Dance performed by the Veselka and Zaharava Ensembles from Sydney.

The show was ably compered by Kristie Carter, a TV presenter from Newcastle, NSW.

The initial dances were interspersed with welcome messages from Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisation (AFUO) officials and official guests.

Some variety was added to the dance spectacle with guest appearances by HRIM, a Ukrainian band from New York, and Danny McGinlay, a Melbourne comedian who has just completed a season at the Melbourne Comedy Festival where he portrayed an Australian about to marry his Ukrainian girlfriend and his attempts to learn Ukrainian.

However the main theme of the show was traditional Ukrainian dancing and not just the Hopak.  The dance ensembles who came from all over Australia provided a vivacious and colourful spectacle, set to lively music.  The dances were representative of different regions of Ukraine, both in dance choreography and traditional costumes.  The list of dances and performers included:

A wonderful time was had by all.

A massive thank you to the Melbourne weather, the organisers who put in such enormous effort to put on this show, and to all the performers who gave such a professional exhibition of Ukrainian dance at its best.

Дякую і велике спасибі.
