Back in the 1980s Bayda Books published some 20 books, many of them novels translated from Ukrainian into English. Once Ukraine became independent we figured that interest in the country would lead mainstream publishers to translate the best authors Ukraine had to offer. But alas this proved not to be so. With perhaps the exception of Andrei Kurkov, who wrote in Russian. Even the efforts of the Open Ukraine Foundation have produced nothing in English. And the university publishers of Canada and the USA have likewise published scant little in the area of fiction.

So – we’re back at it! The first book to appear in August 2010 is Valeriy Shevchuk’s gothic thriller _Lunar Pain_. The book contains an introduction by Marko Pavlyshyn of Monash University, examining the work of this major Ukrainian writer. **Price is $15.95.**
