](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/combined-Inter-Airlines_TravelWiz_Thai-Airlines-thumbnail.jpg)Inter-Airlines and TravelWiz have just published their latest newsletter.  Amongst other services, these two companies organize travel packages to Ukraine.

The Managing Director, Adel Bassili,  is a good friend of the Ukrainian community in Australia, and recently has offered to donate, along with Thai Airlines, a return flight ticket (Australia - Bangkok) to assist in sponsorship of the 'Hopak in the Park' event  in April.
