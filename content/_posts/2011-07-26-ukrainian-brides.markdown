### 60 Minutes - _'Brides in Ukraine'_


 

On Sunday evening 24th July 2011 Channel Nine aired its _60 Minutes_ Program.  This particular program contained a segment on ‘Brides in Ukraine’.  Most viewers of Ukrainian descent, and indeed others, would have found this particular segment offensive based on the following issues.



	  1. ** ****The representation of Ukrainian women** - There may be a minority of women who enter the marriage market,
          but Ukraine has highly educated and successful women . 
﻿
	  2. **The term THE UKRAINE is incorrect -** it is simply and clearly **Ukraine**.  The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade back in the times under Minister Alexander Downer issued a statement on the correct terminology to be used in Australia.  The term is – **Ukraine.**
          The term **The Ukraine** is offensive to Ukrainians.
	  3. During the week leading up to the broadcast of the 60 Minutes program, Channel 9 was contacted by the Embassy of Ukraine in Australia at the request of the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) to discuss the contents of the program.  Embassy Staff was assured that the program would be 'lovely'.
          Obviously 60 Minutes has a skewed interpretation of 'lovely'.

 Attached is a protest letter sent from AFUO that same evening.  [AFUO 60 Minutes doc](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/AFUO-60-Minutes-doc.pdf)


### The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) urges you to contact 60 Minutes via email - 60minutesmail@nine.com.au or by phone on 02 9906 9999 and lodge your protest on the issues explained above.  Encourage 60 Minutes to do a more in-depth analysis of the political situation in Ukraine. This would be of greater benefit to Australians.
