Iryna Sklokina**, a historian at the Centre for Urban History of East Central Europe (Lviv, Ukraine), researches historical heritage, especially the industrial and Soviet heritage of Kharkiv and Lviv. Her dissertation (2014) was on official Soviet policy concerning memory of the Nazi occupation of Ukraine, using the example of the city of Kharkiv. She has worked at Karazin National University and the Kowalsky Eastern Institute of Ukrainian Studies in Kharkiv and participated in international projects on historical memory and oral history, including "Region, Nation and Beyond: An Interdisciplinary and Transcultural Reconceptualisation of Ukraine." In 2012 she held an internship at the University of Toronto's Centre for European, Russian and Eurasian Studies. She is writing a book on Donbas company towns and ways of dealing with their heritage in contemporary Ukraine.
