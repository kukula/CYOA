CYM Melbourneâ€™s Dancing Ensemble Verchovyna is currently touring Ukraine. They performed in Thailand on route.

The Kyiv and Donetsk concerts have been very successful with the group receiving standing ovations.

They have also participated in and given number of workshops.

This is a wonderful opportunity to spread the word about Australia and also give members of the group a chance to experience Ukraine. Their next concert is in Lviv!

Please find attached photos from the Kyiv and Donetsk Opera House and a photo with Verchovyna with the Minister of Culture, Mr. Vovkun, Mr. Dratch and our Kyiv Guest Artists "Zoloti Kljuchi" Nina Matvienko.

We wish them well and safe journey home and to hear about their experiences upon their return.
