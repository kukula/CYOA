_**Make tax-deductible donations to help Ukraine**_


Thankfully we live in a rich and peaceful country but imagine if it wasn’t so. Imagine if Australia was involved in a conflict that resulted in 1.2 million people being displaced and over 3.5 million being war affected, requiring urgent aid. How would we as a rich country, deal with a humanitarian crisis of those proportions? If it went on for over a year it would strain our vast resources and we would likely require the assistance of our international friends to get by.

Now consider how much harder it is for Ukraine as one of Europe’s poorest countries to deal with the crisis facing it today and ask what better friends does it have than those like us in wealthy countries.

The UN currently estimates that over $300 million in aid is needed to relieve the suffering and meet the urgent food, medical and accommodation needs of over 5 million persons from war affected areas in eastern Ukraine. Funds raised in Australia will go directly to Caritas Ukraine to support these efforts. Our aim is to raise $1 million dollars from Australians to ensure these efforts continue.

The establishment of Ukrainian Crisis Relief now makes helping easier. You can make a single donation or contribute monthly and receive a tax deduction for your gift. This way every 55 cents you give provides up to a $1 of aid to Ukraine. The 30th of June is almost upon us so there is no better time to act than now. Visit our website - www.ukrainecrisisappeal.com - appealing for donations that can be made directly online.
Your contributions can touch the lives of many Ukrainians in need – please act now.
