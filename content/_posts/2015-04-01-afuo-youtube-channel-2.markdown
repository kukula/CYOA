**AFUO met the Deputy Head of the foreign affairs committee **

The AFUO delegation and World Congress of Ukrainian representatives met Ms Hanna Hopko, People’s Deputy and Chair of the Ukrainian parliament’s (Rada) Foreign Affairs Committee. Discussion focussed on building better ties by expediting the process of appointing an Ambassador to Australia, dropping the WTO case against Australia, and creating community-based structures for information campaigns to promote Ukraine’s standing abroad. Ms Hopko is clearly a strong up-and-comer in Ukrainian parliamentary politics who is results-focused.

**Ukraine Today TV prepares for broadcasting in Australia **

The AFUO delegation today met with senior execs at Ukraine Today and 1+1 Media Group to discuss sourcing English language news for Australian broadcast. Following engagement with Foxtel, AFUO has created the opportunity for such broadcasts - possibly on SkyNews - subject to production, technical and financial agreements. This would be a positive step to counter RT propaganda with factual and objective news.
