The position of Australia’s Ambassador in Kyiv has also been advertised.

“This announcement is a strong indicator that the Australian Government continues to stand firm in supporting Ukraine. It also shows confidence in Ukraine as a strategic partner,” AFUO Chairman Stefan Romaniw said.

The AFUO has lobbied the Australian Government strongly to have the diplomatic presence in Kyiv extended.

It has hosted numerous events in Kyiv since the opening of the Embassy to ensure that Australia’s presence is felt in Ukraine. The most recent was round table hosted by the AFUO in August this year which was attended by Ukraine’s Ambassador of to Australia - Mykola Kulinich, Chargé d’Affaires Australian Embassy Kyiv, Ukraine - Bruce Edwards, representatives of Ukraine’s Ministries of Health, Foreign Affairs, Interior Affairs, Defence and the Head of the Parliament’s office, Australian business people in Ukraine. The participants   focused on bilateral opportunities.

“Over the next two years we must work together to ensure that Ukraine becomes a key strategic player in Europe, that Australia-Ukraine bilateral relations are strengthen and that trade increases. Having Ukraine as a major player will go a long way in convincing the Australian Government in the future that Kyiv must have an ongoing Australian Embassy.” Mr Romaniw said.

The AFUO will work with both the Australian Embassy in Kyiv and the Embassy of Ukraine in Canberra in developing a strategic work plan to further bilateral relations.

The AFUO acknowledges and thanks Australia’s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, the Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop, her staff and the leadership of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Office of the Prime Minister for their support.

The AFUO extends its thanks to Doug Trappett, the first   Ambassador of Australia  in Kyiv, current Chargé d’Affaires at the Australian Embassy Kyiv, Ukraine - Bruce Edwards  and Embassy staff for their work and support to date.
