## MEDIA RELEASE




## AUSTRALIA SHOULD ASK UN & ALLIES TO DEFEND UKRAINE


The Ukrainian Australian community is strongly requesting that the Australian Government bring to the UN Security Council, as well as its Western democratic allies, the consideration of logistical and military support for Ukraine.

Mr Stefan Romaniw OAM, President of the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations, who is currently contactable in Ukraine, said:

“Under Prime Minister Abbott and Foreign Minister Bishop, Australia has taken an international leadership position in defence of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and democracy. With Vladimir Putin now conducting an invasion of southeastern Ukraine, we believe that the Australian Government should continue that leadership by working with allies for a proportionate and effective response.

“In line with its purpose, the UN Security Council and/or allied Western democracies need to urgently act to support Ukraine’s military self-defence.

“An armed invasion by a major military and nuclear power and its renegade tyrant on to the territory of a small neighbour must be halted to avert the potential violent repression of millions of Ukrainians, as well as to assert global security and stability.

“There are millions of lives and core democratic values at stake here, and Australia’s allies should stop being afraid of Putin when Ukrainians are not.

“This situation has never been a ‘civil war’ and now it is no longer a ‘proxy war’. With the confirmed activity of Russian Federation military regulars on Ukrainian territory, this is an invasion of continental Europe that can no longer be ignored or dealt with through polite diplomatic statements.

“Real action is required now to save real lives. Putin will not be stopped by tweets and hand-wringing, but by materially supporting the Ukrainian self-defence forces.

“By acting to defend Ukraine, the West actually defends itself against Putin’s desire to redraw the international order for his own tyrannical purposes.”
