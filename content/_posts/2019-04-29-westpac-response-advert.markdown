Following the many community complaints to Westpac about the [Fraud Guarantee advertisement which referred to Ukraine](http://www.ozeukes.com/current-affairs/respond-to-westpac-ad/),Â  and following numerous specific conversations with Martine Jager, Chief Digital & Marketing Officer of Westpac group, the advertisement will be withdrawn. Ms Jager apologised on behalf of Westpac and indicated the advertisement was not meant to offend.




We will share the full written response from Westpac when it arrives.




Thank you to all who have been active and responded to our call to action in the past few days, via all the various channels including social media and email.


Call to action complete!


Regards,
