### AUSTRALIA’S UKRAINIAN COMMUNITY APPLAUDS SENATOR JOHN Mc CAIN FOR EXPOSING VLADIMIR PUTIN AS THE WORLD’S BIGGEST THREAT


Australia’s Ukrainian Community applauds US Senator John McCain for again warning the international community that the biggest threat to stability and international peace is Russia’s Vladimir Putin.

Speaking on the 7.30 Report in Australia last night, Senator McCain highlighted the fact Russian President Vladimir Putin is the free world’s greatest ‘threat’.

“It is the Russians who have tried to destroy the very fundamental (basis) of democracy and that is to change the outcome of an American election,” Sen. McCain said.

Senator McCain also pointed to attempts by Putin to meddle with the French election, and the ongoing chaos in Ukraine.

“I see the Russians as the far greatest challenge that we have,”  Sen McCain said.

“The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) reiterates the point it has made previously that Russian aggression in Eastern Ukraine, the annexation of Crimea, the total disrespect for a country’s sovereignty, the snubbing of the Minsk Accords are threats not only to Ukraine but to the international community,” AFUO Chairman Stefan Romaniw said.

“The bigger the Russian footprint in Ukraine the more dangerous and unstable the world becomes,” Mr Romaniw said.

“Ukraine today is the beacon for highlighting Putin’s’ arrogance and disrespect for the world,” Mr Romaniw said.

Putin continues his march and the world needs to stop him.

In Putin’s meeting with newly elected French President Emmanuel Macron this week, he again showed that he will stop at nothing. There are no rules for whether, military, political or historical because there is limited opposition.

Russian President Vladimir Putin in his meetings stated ‘That the Franco-Russian relations began with the marriage of Anna Yaroslavna, middle daughter of Yaroslav the Wise to Henry I in 1051’.

It is a historical fact that Prince Yaroslav Mudrij (Yaroslav the Wise) was Ukrainian.

France and the international community have historically recognized Anna Yaroslavna for her role in Ukraine- French Relations.

Again there is little challenging of Putin’s disinformation and blatant lying.

“Australia’s Ukrainian community calls on the international community to follow Senator McCain’s lead and ‘call a spade, a spade’. Putin is the biggest threat, Putin is the master of disinformation and Putin must be stopped in his tracks.” Mr. Romaniw said.

The AFUO calls for stronger sanctions against Putin and his Administration. It calls on the international community – to provide Ukraine with the military aid required to end the Russian aggression in Ukraine.

“Having achieved this, will lead to a new and more secure world. Stopping the tyrant now in Ukraine, will send Putin a strong message – The world will no longer endure his political games. Isolation, ostracizing him and his Administration are now the key – ‘The Strategy of Talks, Agreements, keeping him close so we can negotiate have failed and will not work – That’s obvious,” Mr. Romaniw said.
