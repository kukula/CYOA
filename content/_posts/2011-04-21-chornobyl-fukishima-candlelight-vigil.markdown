**CANDLELIGHT VIGIL 26 APRIL 2011 SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE**




**REMEMBERING CHERNOBYL – STANDING WITH FUKUSHIMA**




** **




** **




26 April is the 25th anniversary of the world’s worst nuclear catastrophe – Chernobyl in Ukraine. It is also the 6-week anniversary of the still unfolding nuclear disaster of Fukushima, Japan.


A coalition of environmental and anti-nuclear organizations, trade unions, churches and community groups will come together to honour and remember those killed, displaced and sickened by both nuclear crises. With the people of Sydney we will hold a candlelight vigil at the beautiful Sydney opera house.

This is a chance for the people of Sydney to show their support for those suffering in Japan and Ukraine and to stand with both communities as they remember their sick and dispossessed.

It is also an opportunity to respectfully remind the world that nuclear is never safe.

PLEASE COME ALONG AND BRING YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

DATE: Tuesday 26 April 2011

WHERE: Sydney Opera House, Circular Quay, Western side of the building

TIME: 6pm for 6.30pm – 7.30pm

Bring a candle or we will have candles available.
