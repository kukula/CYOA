As Alexandr Dolgopolov prepared himself for the biggest match of his life, hopes were held high for him to deliver a shock blow to 5th seeded Andy Murray, in their Quarter Final clash.

The match opened with ‘the most unpredictable player on the tour’ immediately forcing several back-to-back, break points against the heavily backed Scotsman.
In true form, Murray overcame his initial quarter final jitters and proceeded to take both the first and second sets respectively, 7-5, 6-3.

In the third set, Dolgopolov fired up once again, forcing Murray to a tie-breaker, eventually prevailing and taking it to at least 4 sets.

Not without fight, Murray proceeded to up-the-ante in the fourth, eventually taking out the match in 4 sets: 7-5, 6-3, 6-7, 6-3.

However, Dolgopolov’s efforts were by no means in vain, as he gained many new fans and has now firmly cemented his name on the circuit, as a forced to be reckoned with in the future.

As the final Ukrainian bows out of this year’s Australian Open, on behalf of the AFUO, we congratulate all Ukrainian athletes for their efforts, as well as all the supporters who managed to make it down to Melbourne Park.

Leading into the Australian Open 2012, we will aim to build on this year’s efforts and ensure a firm ‘Uki’ following for next year.

The 2011 Australian Open does continue however and with many top seeded players still in action, be sure to keep watching all the drama and celebrations, as it evolves.
