](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/UEFA_Euro_2012_logo.png)Ticket sales for UEFA EURO 2012 will start on 1 March 2011 through www.UEFA.com and end on 31 March 2011

Any application received after the application closing date will not be processed.

Assuming demand for tickets exceeds supply, a random lottery will determine the successful applications.

Please note: all correctly submitted and accepted applications received between 1 March and 31 March 2011 will be taken into consideration. It makes no difference whether you register early (on 1 March 2011) or later during the month.

Every correctly submitted and accepted application will have the same chance of being allocated tickets in the lottery.

For registration details check:
