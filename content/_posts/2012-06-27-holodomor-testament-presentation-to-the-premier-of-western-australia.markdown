### PREMIER OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA PRESENTED WITH A TESTAMENT OF HOLODOMOR SURVIVORS LIVING IN WA




The Premier of Western Australia The Hon Colin Barnett was presented with a copy of the recently published work by Lesa Melnyczuk titled _Silent Memories - Traumatic Lives - Ukrainian Migrant Refugees in Western Australia._

The book focuses on the traumatic experiences of Holodomor survivors who settled in Western Australia.

A sentence in the book encapsulates its purpose - _"The study adds to mounting evidence of the genocide nature of the Ukrainian Famine of 1932-33 and the lasting effects it had on survivors"._

Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations, (AFUO)  Chairman Stefan Romaniw presented the book to Premier Barnett during  a meeting in Perth on Friday June 22, 2012 .

Mr Romaniw whilst meeting with the Premier on other issues presented the book and held a brief discussion on the Holodomor and issues relating to Ukrainians in WA.

The Premier was also presented with an invitation to launch the book in late July 2012.
