## UHELP UPDATE





	  * **Nearly 4500 personnel trained in Combat Life Saving**
	  * **Some 3500 IFAKs (Improved First Aid Kits) distributed**

The AFUO’s UHELP (Ukrainian Humanitarian, Educational and Leadership Program) has raised some $30,000 to date in Australia to support the first aid training of Ukrainian service personnel and to provide advanced first aid equipment as part of Ukraine’s self-defence.

This has helped to fund nearly 4500 personnel being trained in Combat Life Saving, and some 3500 IFAKs (Improved First Aid Kits) being distributed – which means that lives have been saved by your support during the most recent invasion by Mr Putin’s forces.

The work has taken place through the Ukrainian World Congress’ Humanitarian Initiatives Directorate and the Patriot Defence program. This is a fully-verified program including support by the Prime Minister of Ukraine and other official channels, and the only guarantee that your donations are finding their way to the right places.

A recent medical assessment by the Humanitarian Initiatives Directorate and the Ministry of Defence showed the grim state of Ukraine’s combat medical preparedness – the need for such programs. A related video can be watched below.

In the next 6 weeks, and in order to be prepared as future attacks may occur, it is aimed to have trained an additional 5000 personnel and to have distributed 5000 more IFAKs toward the overall mission goal of 10,000 IFAKs with training.

To complete the mission, the program requires approximately $200,000 – or some $100 per IFAK.
