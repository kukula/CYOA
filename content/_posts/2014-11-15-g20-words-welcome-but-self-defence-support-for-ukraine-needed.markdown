**G20 WORDS WELCOME – BUT SELF-DEFENCE SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE NEEDED**


G20 Leaders need to match their strong anti-Putin action to their strong anti-Putin rhetoric by now providing military assistance for Ukraine’s self-defence, according to the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations.

Stefan Romaniw, President of the AFUO, said today following yesterday’s Protest Against Putin in Brisbane:

“If G20 Leaders’ deeds don’t follow their words, there is every risk of Tsar Putin escalating his invasion of Ukraine to call their bluff. The world becomes a more dangerous place if G20 Leaders don’t immediately provide substantial support for Ukraine’s military self-defence.

“There are clear reports from NATO, as recognised by the UN, of an intense build-up of Russian forces in eastern Ukraine and in border areas, possibly including up to 400 tanks and 40,000 personnel. Words and sanctions alone will not stop these forces from grabbing more of Ukraine’s sovereign territory and costing thousands of lives; weapons are needed.

“Following years of intentional denigration by the former pro-Putin dictator, Ukraine’s military is totally under-supplied on everything from armament systems to medical supplies and training to winter clothing. While highly motivated, they oppose a Putin army that is being rapidly built up.

“While Ukraine has not sought ‘boots on the ground’ from the West, it does deserve the material support of G20 leaders who are recognising that it is the place where the major threat to international peace and prosperity is most apparent. As a buffer to Putin, it does deserve greater political and economic engagement, where countries like Australia can continue its leadership.

“Ukraine’s fight is the world’s fight – and the world needs to invest in defending itself from Putin’s neo-imperial ambitions and aggression.”
