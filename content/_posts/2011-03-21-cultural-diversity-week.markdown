The Multicultural Commission of the Victorian State Government is promoting a Cultural Diversity Week.  This will be held from 19-27 March 2011.  During the Week, Victorians come together to share aspects of their culture, faith and language and celebrate the benefits that multiculturalism brings to the State of Victoria.
