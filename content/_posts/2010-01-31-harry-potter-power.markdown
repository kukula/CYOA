](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/harry-potter-power.jpg)Cairns-based psychologist Dr Julie-Anne Sykley has taken a unique approach to helping young teens deal with anxiety, anger, depression or grief.  Her new book, Harry Potter Power, uses motifs and situations from J.K. Rowling’s popular Harry Potter series and links them to theories and strategies designed to help young people overcome anxiety, anger, depression and grief.  It combines a fun and innovated use of Harry Potter icons with more serious advice, reflection material and activities to help teens and young adults.

Drawing on more than 20 years experience, from inner city Sydney to the remote Territory outback, Dr Sykley has helped people from all walks of life with various mental health issues.  She has several academic and written achievements, and uses her vast and varied work experience combined with real world issues to create a practical and thought-provoking tool for young people to develop resilience and self-esteem.

The book has been endorsed by several recognised specialists in psychology, such as Associate Professor James Bennett Levy and psychologist Bill Huntley.  “Excellent… powerful for young people,” said Mr Huntley, referring to the chapter on dealing with tragedy.

“This book is so clever,” said Associate Professor Bennett. “Dr Sykley creatively uses the Harry Potter series so that young people can readily recognise the Dementors of Depression, the Boggarts of Anxiety and Manticores of Anger.”  In ‘The Power of Thoughts’ chapter, James advised readers to “swing into action with some serious dis-spelling!”

Jonty Bush, 2009 Young Australian of the Year and Chief Executive Officer of the Queensland Homicide Victims Support Group called the book, “contemporary, refreshing and uplifting.”

The book is perfect for children aged 12 and over, suffering from anxiety, anger, depression or grief, and encourages communication about the issues between young adults and their parents or guardians.  Psychologists, counsellors and other helping professionals will look to this as a tool to use with their patients.

The book will be available from IP Sales from March 2010.
