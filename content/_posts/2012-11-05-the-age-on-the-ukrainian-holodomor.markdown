](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/theage_com.jpg)Ukrainian communities around the world are campaigning for global recognition of a horror that killed an estimated seven to 10 million Ukrainians during the Holodomor, the devastating famine that swept the nation during 1931-1932 as a direct result of Stalin's collectivisation and the Soviet Union's determination to wipe out Ukrainian nationalism.

_The Age _has published a multimedia article about this campaign at [http://www.theage.com.au/multimedia/ukrainefamine/main.html](http://www.theage.com.au/multimedia/ukrainefamine/main.html)
