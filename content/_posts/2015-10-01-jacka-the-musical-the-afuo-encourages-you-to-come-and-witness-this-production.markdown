**JACKA THE MUSICAL**




**The AFUO encourages you to come and witness this production**


As many of you may be aware  Prof Michael Lawriwsky wrote a book about Albert Jacka and his role in WWI. Jacka received Australia's first Victoria Cross of the war.

_“He was one of the first people among 300,000 plus Australians to volunteer,"._

_"It was just that adventurous spirit he had."_

_A private in the 14th Battalion, Jacka landed at Anzac Cove late in the day on April 25 and was soon on his way to the frontline._

_In Jacka's case this turned out to be Courtney's Post, about a kilometre inland from the beach and one of the most dangerous spots on the peninsula_. noted Jacka's biographer Michael Lawriwsky


_He thought if you got a VC you had to stick with the men. You couldn't just rest on your laurels and go away. You had to stick it out and take the same chances as everybody else._




Michael Lawriwsky, biographer

Australia has never seen anything like it before. An incredible roller-coaster ride of emotions, it depicts the drama and tragedy of key battles at Gallipoli and the Western Front, a number of Aussie larrikin comedy routines including a football-rugby stand-off, a casino/bar room brawl in Cairo, a song about ‘two-up’, and a love story set in Scotland. With costumes, innovative sets, pyro-technics and the backing of a 25 piece orchestra, it will leave the audience enthralled.
