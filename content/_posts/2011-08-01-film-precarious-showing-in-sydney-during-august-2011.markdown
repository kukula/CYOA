_“Precarious”_ is the first feature film by Australian artist Merilyn Faisrskye.  It is a haunting evocation of the aftermath of the explosion at Chornobyl, 25 years on. This road movie takes the spectator on a bleak journey from the shores of the Black Sea to the frozen heart of Chornobyl, passing through desolate, snowy landscapes, littered with abandoned villages.

_Precarious_ and a related photographic exhibition called _Plant Life II_ will be shown for one month at Stills Gallery, Sydney from 3 August - 3 September 2011
