## **Holodomor Commemoration in Western Australia**


Following liturgies at both the Ukrainian Catholic and Orthodox Churches a combined panahyda in remembrance of the 1932-1933 Holodomor was carried out by Very Fathers W. Kalinecki, V. Mowtschan and W. Zayko at the Ukrainian Orthodox Church with 70 people in attendance.[![](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Holodomor-11.jpg)

At the conclusion of the panahyda, the W.A. Vesna Choir with choirmaster Suzanna Prushynsky, sang “Prosymo Tja Divo” and “Jak Slavny Nash Hospod’, following which everyone was invited to stay for speeches and light refreshments in the Orthodox Church Hall.

The President of the Ukrainian Association in W.A. Mr Mykola Mowczan reminded everyone what is the meaning of Holodomor and why we should remember. He reflected on why it is truly a genocide stating that, it was not the crop or harvest of the 1932 – 1933 period rather it was Stalin’s totalitarian regime which deliberately created conditions so that Ukrainians that could not support life.

In concluding Mykola Mowczan stated that “Stalin’s goal was the destruction of the Ukrainian nation.  He almost succeeded! It took almost 80 years after the Holodomor for Ukraine to gain independence. All of us sitting in this hall have been affected in one way or another as a result of the Holodomor and ensuing World War II with loss of family and loved ones. Today, this “collectivization” and “genocide” continues, the loss of national identity and pride through the loss of our beautiful Ukrainian language is the reality. We should remember history and be proud of our identity. [![](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Holodomor-31.jpg)

We should be proud of our Ukrainian language, of our history and our parent’s Ukrainian birth right. We should NOT ONLY REMEMBER but we should all actively engage in speaking our Ukrainian language, promoting national pride showing an example for our brothers and sisters in Ukraine so that Stalin and his objectives NEVER manifest themselves again.”

 Mykola Mowczan introduced Dr Lesa Melnyczuk. It was poignant for her to share the unveiling of the replica Monument of the original that she had seen on past visits to Kyiv to honour Holodomor victims. Dr Melnyczuk used the occasion to remind people of the origins of the Western Australian survivors of the Holodomor. She read out the names of the oblasts that were home to the people whom she interviewed for her doctoral research. Dr Morgan also read an excerpt from her forthcoming book which reflected the devastation and desecration of Ukrainian Orthodox churches and their priests during the period of repressions and famine.

This lady had been back to visit her village in the 1980s and was given an icon that had been hidden during the Holodomor. The icon was one of many that had been hidden from the communists during those years. The villagers have since maintained this priest’s house and the precious icons were again hanging as before.  Upon her return to Perth, the icon was donated to her Orthodox Church and hangs there to this day. It was a feature alongside the replica memorial.
