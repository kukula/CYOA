](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/aus-gov-DFAT-small.jpg)Following representations, the AFUO has received the following position from the Australian Government with regard to the current events in Ukraine. AFUO acknowledges and thanks the Australian Government, and calls on it to take further steps - including in Parliament and in the lead-up to 2015 Presidential elections - to support Euro-integration and democratisation. The Australian Government's position follows public statements by the Canadian Government, the US State Department and the President of the EC.
