](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/kalyna-care-thumb-logo.jpg)Kalyna Care is an aged care facility that caters to the needs of elderly people including those of Ukrainian background.  There are many lonely “babas” and “didos” who would love to be adopted. 



	  * Are you friendly, caring and a good listener?
	  * Would you like to enrich the lives of our elders?
	  * Can you spare some time to provide companionship to those who now need it most?
	  * Would you like to practice and improve your Ukrainian language skills?
	  * Dare you match your relative youth against time-tested experience?
	  * Would you like to pass on some of your skills and knowledge to others?
	  * Are you prepared to give back something to those who laid the foundations of the Ukrainian community here in Australia?

If you can answer yes to at least one of the above or similar questions maybe you should consider the **_Adopt a "Baba” or “Dido" Program_** being promoted by Kalyna Care.  See poster below

The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) strongly supports this program and encourages people of all ages and backgrounds to avail themselves of this opportunity and to show we are a caring community.
