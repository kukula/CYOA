The Association of Ukrainians in Victoria (AUV) is holding its Malanka 2012 on Saturday 14th January 2012 at the Melrose Reception Centre, corner of Melrose and Carrick Drives, Tullamarine.

Entertainment will be provided by the 8 piece Ukrainian Band (UB) from Edmonton, Canada****

UB is a modern high energy band inspired by their Ukrainian-Canadian roots.  Their music is a blend of traditional Ukrainian zabava (dance) music, from both Canada and Ukraine, with rock n' roll.

In addition there will be a special guest performance: RUKOPASH HOPAK FROM UKRAINE.

With a “Ukrainian” theme, there will be prizes for 'Most traditional/vintage outfit' and for the creative party-goers, 'Best appropriation of Ukrainian dress'.

Tickets are $85 per person (with $10 discount for AUV members and concession card holders).  Ticket price Includes: 5 Course Meal, Beer, Wine and Soft drinks.  (BYO Spirits Only).****
