The Shevchenko concert-cabaret held on Sunday 12 March was a great success. About 250 people attended this event. Attending our concert were Peter Malinauskas MLC, David Pisoni MP, Michael Atkinson MP, Jennifer Rankine MP, Hon. Grace Portolesi, Angela Evans - Mayor of the City of Charles Sturt, and the presidents of the Belarus, Croatian, German, Hungarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Scottish and Spanish associations. Very positive comments were made by all and especially the Croatian, German, Lithuanian and Scottish presidents.

Attached is the [visual presentation](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Shevchenko-Visual-Presentation.pdf) - with lots of photos - made at the concert - in PDF format. We should never under-estimate the extra-ordinary contribution Shevchenko made to Ukrainian literature and national identity. He was a genius. This presentation highlights how Shevchenko’s influence has spread around the world and has come to the attention of many American, Canadian and European Presidents, Prime Ministers, Foreign Ministers and Governors.

Peter Burak, who has taken professional-quality photos at many of our events, attended the concert. The photos he took will be posted on our AUSA facebook page and in the next AUSA newsletter.
