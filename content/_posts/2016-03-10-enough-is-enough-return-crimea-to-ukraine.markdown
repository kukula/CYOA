#### **Peak Ukrainian body of Australia says enough is enough, return Crimea to Ukraine****_

18 March 2016 will mark two years of Russian occupation in Crimea. The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) urges the Australian government and the international community to uphold sanctions against the Russian Federation until it withdraws from Crimea and east Ukraine.

The Ukrainian peninsula was seized by the Russian Federation in March 2014. Following the ousting of then pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych after months of protests, Russia took advantage of the fragile interim government in Ukraine at the time and swiftly annexed Crimea.

AFUO Chairman, Stefan Romaniw said “It’s been two years but Crimea is far from lost to Ukraine. The Ukrainian government is determined to ensure it is returned to them, however, for this to happen international pressure must continue.”

Australia announced sanctions against Russia in March 2014, immediately after its annexation of Crimea. Sanctions were expanded in September 2014 and again in March 2015 in response to Russia’s ongoing threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.

“Economically, Crimea is suffering, as are its native Crimean Tatars. The international community cannot afford to ease off on Vladimir Putin. Russia’s actions in Syria are a testament to his complete lack of conscience.” Romaniw said.

The AFUO Calls on the Australian Government to:



 	  * publically reinforce its condemnation of ongoing aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine
 	  * demand Crimea by returned to Ukraine and
 	  * that violation of human rights be investigated and those responsible be brought to justice in international courts
