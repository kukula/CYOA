Julie Nalivaiko was born in Kyiv, Ukraine, and 14 years ago, aged 13, moved to Australia.  She now lives in Newcastle, New South Wales. 

Recently she teamed up with Stuart McBratney, a filmmaker with 25 years experience, to document everyday life in Ukraine and Russia.  Having spent 2 months filming on location, they are now seeking funds to complete work on a 4-part TV series called _Back in the Soviet Bloc_.  Two of the four episodes will focus on Ukraine.

Information about the funding needs can be read on the related media release:     [MEDIA_RELEASE_-_Back_in_the_Soviet_Bloc](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/MEDIA_RELEASE_-_Back_in_the_Soviet_Bloc1.pdf)
