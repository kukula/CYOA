The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisation (AFUO) congratulates Malcolm Turnbull on becoming the 29th Prime Minister of Australia while strongly thanking Tony Abbott for his outstanding contribution in relation to Ukraine during his Prime Ministership.

Mr Stefan Romaniw OAM, President of the AFUO, said:

“We were delighted when Malcolm Turnbull approached the AFUO to become a member of the Parliamentary Friendship Group for Ukraine, as it shows his commitment to its sovereignty and on-going democratisation.

“We, and the Ukrainian Australians who live in the electorate of Wentworth, look forward to working with Prime Minister Turnbull as Ukraine seeks to protect its borders and grow its economy.”

“We take this opportunity to acknowledge Tony Abbott’s international leadership in relation to Ukraine. His achievements are numerous including:



	  * being the first Prime Minister to acknowledge and mark the Holodomor;
	  * introducing sanctions against the Russian Federation;
	  * condemning in the strongest possible terms the invasions of Crimea and eastern Ukraine;
	  * providing logistical support for Ukraine’s self-defence;
	  * inviting President Poroshenko to become the first Ukrainian President to visit Australia;
	  * announcing uranium trade with Ukraine;
	  * seeking justice for the Australian victims of MH17 and expertly overseeing with Minister Bishop the post-tragedy efforts;
	  * opening an Australian Embassy in Kyiv and switching visa processes from Moscow to the High Commission in London;
	  * and showing great resolve in standing up to Vladimir Putin like no other western leader.”

“Tony Abbott is Ukraine’s greatest friend and we as Ukrainian Australians will always return that friendship, including presenting him with the inaugural Ukraine-Australia Freedom Award at the upcoming OzUke2015 bilateral relations forum in Melbourne on November 25 and 26.”
