Theo Andruszko who passed away in November 2015 was awarded “Senior Volunteer of the Year” posthumously.

Alexander Andruszko accepted the award on behalf of his late father. Four members of the Andruszko family (one of whom flew in from Sydney) were there to represent their father.




For five decades, Theo was an integral part of Adelaide’s Ukrainian community. He documented the community’s history in several books, edited the Ukrainian Association monthly newsletter for eight years, volunteered his time and expertise at a state and federal level, and acted as a mentor. Little wonder that people describe him as a “treasure” to the community. This award is a fitting tribute to honour Theo and his achievements in the Ukrainian community.

Present at the ceremony were His Excellency The Honourable Hieu Van Le AO, Lieutenant Governor of South Australia; the Premier, Jay Weatherill, the Leader of the Opposition Steven Marshal, the Lord Mayor of Adelaide, Martin Haese; and a host of ministers and other dignitaries. The Ukrainian community was well represented – Irena Boujenko, Natalia Boujenko, Ludmilla Ostapuk, Aliona King, Oksana Kosak, Jurij Wasyluk and Frank Fursenko attended the ceremony.
