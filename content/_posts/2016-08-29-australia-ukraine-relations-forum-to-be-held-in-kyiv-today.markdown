“The AFUO is actively involved in a practical way in strengthening bilateral relations. Over the past week we have meet with:

 	  * President of Ukraine’s’ Administration,
 	  * Ministers of Health, Internal Affairs, Culture, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, representatives of the Ministry of Economic Development, Education and others

to highlight the importance of seeking practical outcomes and making Australia – Ukraine relations a focus,” Stefan Romaniw Chairman of the AFUO said in Kyiv today.

“Today’s forum should identify practical projects that could be undertaken under our banner - _From Rhetoric to Action_. Diplomatic, consular, economic and other relations need to be enhanced,” Mr Romaniw said.

“We also will be seeking to argue that strengthening the role of both Embassies -Kyiv and Canberra is a must if we are to achieve real outcomes,” Mr Romaniw  said.

“A strong, ongoing Australian Embassy in Kyiv shows political strength and support at this time that Australia continues to support Ukraine against Russian aggression.

The Final Report on the MH 17 tragedy will be released shortly. An ongoing Australian presence in Kyiv is a show of international strength,” Mr Romaniw said.
