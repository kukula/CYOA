](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Multicultural-Youth-Sports-Grants.jpg)On Friday 29 April 2011, as part of the Federal Government's commitment to increasing participation in sport, Minister for Sport Mark Arbib and Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Kate Lundy officially opened applications for the Multicultural Youth Sports Partnership Program.

The Program will provide grants of between $5000 and $50 000 to create opportunities for young people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, to engage with sport and physical activity. The opening of the grant applications is a commitment, from the Australian Government, to promoting social cohesion and building a more inclusive multicultural society.

Applications will open for a period of four weeks from 29 April 2011. Successful applicants will be announced in July 2011.
