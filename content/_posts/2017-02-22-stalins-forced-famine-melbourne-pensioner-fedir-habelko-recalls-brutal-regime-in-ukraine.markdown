_WHEN Fedir Habelko was a young teenager in his native Ukraine in the early 1930s he witnessed one of the greatest crimes of the 20th century._

Millions of people died when Soviet Union dictator Joseph Stalin unleashed a forced famine in a bid to bring the occupied nation to heel.

Known to Ukrainians as the Holodomor, Communist authorities went to extreme lengths to stop people getting food under a ruthless policy to force peasants into collective farms.

...

Mr Habelko is grateful that a new English language movie about the tragedy, Bitter Harvest, has been released.
And he believes the issue has timely relevance because of Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014, and Russia’s current support of separatists in eastern Ukraine.

The film, which stars Max Irons and Terence Stamp, will screen in selected Australian cinemas from February 23.
