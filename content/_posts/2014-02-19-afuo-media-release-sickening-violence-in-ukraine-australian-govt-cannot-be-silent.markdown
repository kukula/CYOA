In one of the deadliest events so far in the EuroMaidan demonstrations, Ukrainian riot police (Berkut) charged protesters in central Kyiv late on Tuesday evening, 18th February 2014. 

Police battled their way into Independence Square, centre of three months of protests against Russian-backed President Viktor Yanukovich.  Latest reports put the confirmed deaths at 22, with over a thousand people injured.

International leaders (from Germany, Canada, USA, EU, Sweden and elsewhere) have expressed outrage over the dramatic escalation in tensions and have called for a quick resolution to the stand-off.  The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) has called on the Australian government to add its voice to those of its international colleagues in condemning these atrocities.  

The following statement has been issued by the AFUO:  [MEDIA RELEASE - SICKENING VIOLENCE IN UKRAINE](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MEDIA-RELEASE-SICKENING-VIOLENCE-IN-UKRAINE.pdf)

 The AFUO has also written to the office of the Australian Prime Minister.  The letter reads:  [AFUO letter to Prime Minister Feb 19](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AFUO-letter-to-Prime-Minister-Feb-19.pdf)
