(May 8 2012)

Speaking in a relaxed and professional manner Dr Kvit commenced his presentation beginning with the Holodomor (1932 to 1933) which occurred in the period of the Soviet occupation of Ukraine (1918 to 1991).  He spoke passionately including recollections of the Holodomor from a personal perspective.

Dr Serhiy Kvit also related the history of the National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy (NaUKMA) from its inception in 1615 to the present; including the University's involvement in the Orange Revolution.  He revealed that the Orange revolution's slogan "Razom nas bahato! Nas ne podolaty!" ("Together, we are many! We cannot be defeated!"), the rhythmic chant that spread through the crowd of hundreds of thousands that filled Kyiv's Independence Square on the evening of November 22, 2004, was coined earlier by students of the NaUKMA; and these students were to be the first activists of the Orange Revolution!

The question time began passionately with people sharing their families grief during the Holodomor period with questions relating to the sociological and psychological consequences.  The current Ukrainian situation was also something people wanted to hear about and Dr Kvit answers were well accepted.

So much history was revealed in such little time and yet the delivery was compelling and complete; and left you wanting more was fact that the lecture would have gone well past the completion time was proof that it was well received by all present.  Afterwards many people approached Dr Kvit to congratulate and continue discussions and questions.

Metropolitan Petro Mohyla most certainly smiles to have such a worthy successor to the university that he founded (initially called the Kyiv Brotherhood School in 1615; the Kyiv-Mohyla Collegium in 1632 and finally, the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy in 1658) as Dr Serhiy Kvit.
