Approximately 400 members of the Ukrainian community turned out in Melbourne on Tuesday 4th February 2014.  They were joined by the Hon. Matthew Guy, priests from the Ukrainian Catholic Church as well as many other nationalities - Polish, Slovaks, Italians and Georgians.

The rally commenced with a march from Treasury Gardens (near Parliament) to the City Square (opposite Melbourne Town Hall).  Victoria Police did a fine job escorting the crowd down Collins Street.
