Australia will host Ukraine in a Fed Cup tie in April for the right to stay in the World Group.

The Fed Cup was launched in 1963 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the International Tennis Federation (ITF).  It’s now the world’s largest annual international team competition in women’s sport, with 80 nations competing in 2010.

Mount Waverley 3149

 Teams are not officially nominated yet, but the most likely scenario is:

**Australia:** Sam Stosur, Jarmila Groth, Anastasia Rodionova, Jelena Dokic

**Ukraine:** Lesia Tsurenko, Maria Korytseva, Yulia Beygelzimer, Victoria Kutuzova. (The Bondarenko sisters are unlikely to come as Alona is still recovering after her knee operation and Katerina is just out from an injury).

Konstantin Pinchuk is looking for some support for the Ukrainian girls and may have a few free tickets provided by the Ukrainian team, but at this stage is not sure how many.  There are about 20 people now who are glad to come and support.  More are needed.

Konstantin can be contacted via e-mail at [kpinchuk@gmail.com](mailto:kpinchuk@gmail.com)
