**SUNDAY ~ NOVEMBER 13******

**CYM "St Michael's Day" BBQ**

 CYM Perth will be celebrating Saint Michael's day at Bardon Park in Maylands from 1200.

CYM will provide meat and buns.   Please bring a salad and some chairs.

Given the promise of better weather for the day (partly cloudy and 23) it will be a great time to catch up particularly before the Christmas rush takes place.

We will also have the CYM polo shirt  sample on display and can answer any questions regarding camp.

Feel free to email if you have a query.

 Time is running out to order your CYM Polo shirt. They are very good quality and are a bargain at $15 for CYM members and $20 for non-members. At $20 maximum to be a CYM financial member, it is worth considering financial membership as you will save lots on this year’s camp, throughout next year AND at next CYM camp in 2012.

Please email your name, size, and contact number and transfer the money to the account attached in the order form.

 See you all on Sunday

 Regards

John Karpewycz
