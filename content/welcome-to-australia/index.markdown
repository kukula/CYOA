. . . and most importantly welcome to our Ukrainian Community in Australia.

You have made Australia your new home!

Since 1948Â many Ukrainians have settled here. The community has and continues to be a major support structure as it connects people.

From this connectivity the paths and roads are endless - spiritual needs are fulfilled, friendships formed, social, cultural, sporting, educational, business and other needs can addressed and supported.

Most importantly all our new friends who arrive are most welcome and are invited to seek support, advice. Whether we arrived in 1940s, 1960s, 1990s, 2000s or now or whether we were born here **we are all one** . . . as we make up this community called **Ukrainian**.

Todays's reality is we have many combinations in our Community; those who have married within the Ukrainian community, those who are in a mixed marriage, those who speak fluent Ukrainian, those who speak no Ukrainian, those who grew up in Ukraine those who were born in Australia or in other parts of the world We have a range of faiths and denominations. The 2011 Census gives you a snapshot of who we are: [Census 2011, Ukrainian Information](https://www.dss.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/02_2014/ukraine.pdf).

Collectively we all form this community and all are welcome!
