In describing the horrors of the Holodomor in her recently published Red Famine: Stalin’s War on Ukraine, Anne Applebaum describes the brigades who came house to house to search for and confiscate food from the starving: “With each passing day, demands became angrier, the language ruder: Why haven’t you disappeared yet? Why haven’t you dropped dead yet? _Why are you alive at all?”_

We will not and must not let the world forget this atrocity.
