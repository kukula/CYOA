## Iryna Andreeva


![Iryna Andreeva](http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Irina-200x300.jpg)
My name is Iryna Andreeva.

I came on board the AFUO executive as Immigration and Welfare committee representative.

My firsthand experience as a newcomer to this country in 1988, has led me to better understand the specific needs encountered by recently arrived Ukrainians in Australia.

Over the past 20 years the focus of my observation includes the social construction of identity of newly arrived Ukrainian immigrants in Australia and the impact of immigration on children. As acculturation and assimilation is the biggest problem faced by our community, my aim is to help immigrants to overcome the challenges of integration while retaining the essential qualities of their Ukrainian heritage.


## **My vision**:


I believe that Ukrainian identity is paramount both for newly arrived Immigrants and Diaspora members and it is imperative for the new recently arrived immigrants to establish ties and bonds with fellow members of Ukrainian Australian community.

My colleagues and I on the committee will work together to help promote through cultural events, business, social activities opportunities for Ukrainians to get involved. Together, let us support our vibrant Ukrainian community to maintain and preserve our culture, religion, language and identity.
