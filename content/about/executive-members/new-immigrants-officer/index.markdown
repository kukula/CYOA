## Maria Verbovetski


Hi, my name is Maria Verbovetski, and this is my first term on board the AFUO executive as Immigration and Welfare committee representative of which I look forward to making a positive contribution. Since arriving to my new home â€“ Australia and becoming an Australian Ukrainian, I have always involved myself in community life. It is through my experience as a new Australian from Ukraine that I see my role as a very important one to welcome, nuture and introduce newly arrived migrants to our wonderful Australian life and to the important foundations of Ukrainian culture and community life in Australia.


## My vision:





	  * Promotion of the Ukrainian community in wider Australian community (e.g. celebration of Independence Day on Federation Square, concerts, festivals)
	  * Greater involvement of the Ukrainian immigrants in our community life ( through our churches, schools, clubs, associations)
	  * Strategic planning of the events and ways which will help us grow as a community and how collaboratively we can contribute to its growth.

Recently I had a wonderful opportunity to visit and embrace the concepts of a well organised Immigration Committee in Adelaide, SA. The Committee developed programs and community incentives and as a result has achieved fantastic results. I look forward to striving and implementing some of their strategies and will learn through their experiences I welcome readers to provide new ideas of engaging and welcoming our newly arrived individuals and families to Australia. Our Ukrainian Community is alive and vibrant, let us group and contribute more to its success.
