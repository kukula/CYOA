## Stefan Romaniw OAM

Hi I'm Stefan Romaniw and I am Chairman of the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations.

My interests lie in the ongoing development of the AFUO and our community.

The challenge is to provide leadership that is able to meet the challenges of the time and the different stakeholders and members in our community.

It's about making not just the AFUO but our community relevant and effective. My life has taken me into a range of Ukrainian organisations I have worked in many settings professionally. These have opened doors and have given me a solid grounding.

I really enjoy Australian rules football - Essendon's the team and I try not have meetings when Essendon is playing


## Role description





	  * To provide leadership
	  * Together with our committee set the direction of the AFUO and our community
	  * Engage membership in implementing set plans
	  * Represent our community in the broader community
	  * Plan for succession



## My vision


To help build a healthy and vibrant Ukrainian community with strong values that is relevant and inclusive and that is well respected in the broader community.
