Hi, my name is Alex.

Welcome to AFUOâ€™s first official dedicated Sports Page. On this page, you will find everything from the latest news, key sporting contact details and other general information that will hopefully serve purpose.

As Sports Director/II Deputy Chair for AFUO , I see my responsibility as being a key liaison for all Ukrainian-Australian sports domestically and internationally. In addition to creating a central information portal for Ukrainian Sport in Australia, my plans are to gradually build a comprehensive sporting network for all interested parties to utilise and benefit from.


## Vision:





	  * To promote & support Ukrainian-Australian Sports Domestically & Internationally.
	  * To create and sustain a functional communication network for all Ukrainian Sporting disciplines across Australia.
	  * Centralise all Ukrainian-Australian sporting activities through one comprehensive portal
	  * Spread the Ukrainian-Australian sporting passion!

Working with the Ukrainian Olympic & Paralympic Team in Sydney 2000, sparked my desire to pursue an ongoing interest with Ukrainian Sport in Australia & abroad. I indeed hope to spread this passion and build a fun, useful framework for all sports lovers!

Hopefully you find this page as a useful tool to your sporting needs. However, feel free to write to me and provide any suggestions or requests.

We welcome your input and ideas!

Yours in Sport!

Alexander Dechnicz
