COMMUNITY UPDATE

Good responses are being received from across the Ukrainian Australian community and its friends about the Protest Against Putin on Saturday, November 15 at 1pm in front of Brisbane City Hall (King George Square).

Please note:

A) take public transport into the Brisbane CBD and allow plenty of travel time;

B) bring signs on the anti-Putin theme;

C) make the signs hand-held, rather than mounted on sticks etc, as per Police request;

D) always show the democratic and civilised practice of our community - in stark contrast to Mr Putin's behaviours;

E) cooperate with requests by our own marshals and emcee, and the Police, and avoid any potential Putin provocateurs.

Note that there are suggestions of potential digital mischief about the date, time and place of the rally. If true, this would be typical of the digital disinformation campaign being run by the RF on an international basis.

Only this is right: Saturday, November 15 at 1pm out front of Brisbane City Hall (King George Square).
