Once the first migration ship of Ukrainian immigrants touched Australia soil in 1947 the foundations of Ukrainian Community life began. From Churches, Associations and Dance Ensembles, third and forth Generation Australian Ukrainians sustain a close identity with their ancestry, together with new immigrants who bring a rich dimension to our community.


## Nicolai Miklouho-Maclay (1846-1888)


The First Ukrainian in Australia?

A Ukrainian explorer, naturalist and ethnographer who visited Australia in 1878. Miklouho-Maclay is remembered most in Australia for being instrumental in establishing Australia's first biological field station at Watson's Bay in 1881. Miklouho-Maclay is often erroneously reported as being Russian, since Ukraine was then part of the Tsarist Empire. Miklouho-Maclay may well be the first Ukrainian in Australia. The University of Sydney offers a Mikloucho-Maclay Fellowship for research work.
