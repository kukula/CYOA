MEDIA RELEASE
Russian President Vladimir Putin has once again committed an act of aggression against Ukraine by signing a decree setting out which groups of people are, for humanitarian reasons, entitled to apply for Russian citizenship through a simplified procedure in the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk currently under occupation by the Russian Army.____
According to the decree, the Russian president made the decision &amp;ldquo;in order to protect human and citizen rights and freedoms&amp;rdquo; based on &amp;ldquo;commonly recognised principles and norms of international law&amp;rdquo; in accordance with the Russian Law on citizenship from May 31, 2002.</description>
