      <description>USC took out the 2014 Maribyrnong Volleyball Championships in the Open Men&amp;rsquo;s division, on Sunday the 15th of June, held at the Maribyrnong Sports Academy. Topping their group and cruising through the cross over, the USC boys played a great brand of volleyball. However, the grand final proved to be a greater test against BLASH.
Dropping the first set 25-18, USC pulled it together in the second set to take it 25-17.</description>
