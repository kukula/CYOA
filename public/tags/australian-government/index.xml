      <description>On November 25, 2018, Ukrainian Naval vessels were attacked by Russian forces as they were departing from the area of the Kerch Strait and moving back into the Black Sea. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has announced that &amp;ldquo;Russian special forces have taken over some [Ukrainian] ships.&amp;rdquo; Over a half-dozen Ukrainian service members have been injured, and up to 20 are being held captive by Russian forces.
This was a premeditated and deliberate act of aggression against Ukraine by Russia.</description>
