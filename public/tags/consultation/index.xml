      <description>The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) is embarking on a National consultation program. We want to be able to plan, build on the past and identify and avoid barriers that may have halted or continue to stem our progress. We invite you to make your opinions and proposals known. This is an open invitation to everyone- regardless of your activity or inactivity within the community. We encourage those who have come into the community through marriage, friendship or relationships to also provide input.</description>
