      <description>Dear Friends, The Association of Ukrainians in Victoria is embarking on an exciting new project which involves fundraising for a multi-storey office development Righton Russell St, in the hub of Essendon.
Project Overview: Located within 10km of Melbourne’s CBD, Righton Russell aims to be utilized as leased commercial office space. The income generated from the development aims to provide the A.U.V. with a sustainable income stream, that in turn will help support Victoria’s wider Ukrainian community.</description>
