    <h1>Local European Business Expo 2016 in Perth</h1>
    
    <p>Dear Ukrainian Hromada,</p>
<p>The Australia-Ukraine Chamber of Commerce (AUCC) is excited to invite your company’s participation in the second edition of the Community Business Expo called “Local European Business Expo 2016” in Western Australia on September 18, 2016</p>
<p>The Local European Business Expo 2016 is an initiative originated from the first edition of “Polish Business Expo 2015” organised by Aneta Gradek and the Polish Community called “Positive Woman Club” in Sept 2015 at Sikorski Club. Realising the potential benefits of the Expo, the Hungarian and Ukrainian representatives have joined to the committee and further developed the formula of the Local European Business Expo by inviting Hungarian and Ukrainian businesses based in Perth.</p>
<p>The joint trade show will be run in conjunction with the Polish Embassy in Canberra, Polish Chamber of Commerce, Honorary Consul of Poland, The Ukrainian Association of WA, and Australian Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce, The Hungarian Association of WA and the Honorary Consul of Hungary. The Event will be hosted by Polish Community at the Polish Community Club Cracovia.</p>
<p>WA Minister Of Commerce Hon Michael Mischin will open the Local European Business Expo 2016. The list of VIP guests of the event includes Local Politicians, Honorary Consuls from WA, The Hungarian Trading Commissioner, Business Representatives, and State Representatives of participating countries’ Chambers of Commerce.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian Community will be represented by eight businesses and places have been assigned on a first come first served basis. At this stage, we’ve closed an application process, but if your business is interested in participation, please contact one of the Committee members listed below and discuss possibility of adding your business to the waiting list, if some of the currently participating businesses cancel their registration.</p>
<p>Participation cost for individual businesses is $50 per table; additionally you can showcase your business on the main stage (up to 15 minutes) for $15; and admission to the “After-Event Party” $20 (all prices are GST excluded). Most tables will have access to electricity. If your business will be using specific props please let us know. Also if you need displays, billboards or the like please contact the Committee and we may be able to source such items for you at a reasonable cost.</p>
