<p><strong>AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT CALLS IN UKRAINE EMBASSY TO OBJECT TO VIOLENCE – DFAT ADVICE</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Senior Australian diplomats acting for the Minister of Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop MP have officially conveyed the Australian Government's deep concern about recent violent clashes in Kyiv to the Government of Ukraine, according to the AFUO.</p>
<p>At a meeting with the AFUO President Stefan Romaniw OAM on Friday, January 24, senior Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials (DFAT) advised that Chargés d'Affaires of Ukraine in Australia Stanislav Stashevskyi was requested to meet with key officials to be provided with a direct Government-to-Government message.</p>
<p>It is understood that the Australia Government:</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>  * expressed concern about the death of protestors and the disappearance of other activists, and indicated that those responsible must be held to account;
  * expressed concern about the adoption by the Yanukovych regime of anti-dissent laws on January 16, 2014;
  * highlighted that the fundamental rights of people to freedom of assembly and speech must be upheld in accordance with Ukraine's international obligations;
  * called for maximum restraint by all sides to avoid any escalation of violence, and;
  * called on the Ukrainian Government to commit itself to constructive dialogue and respect for the aspirations of the Ukrainian people.
</code></pre>
<p>“The AFUO has consistently called on the Australian Government to make a strong statement on behalf of the Australian people,” Mr Romaniw said.</p>
<p>“We welcome the Australian Government’s strong position conveyed to the Ukrainian Government. We call on the Australian Government to continue to consider sanctions and other actions to ensure that the Ukrainian Government is held to account,” Mr Romaniw said.</p>
<p>Mr Romaniw also said he has spoken to the Chargés d’Affaires of Ukraine in Canberra and voiced the Ukrainian Australian community's concerns about the situation in Ukraine.</p>
<p>He passed on the resolutions adopted at community rallies condemning the anti democratic laws accepted on January 16 and the violence in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian Australian community in Sydney will conduct a memorial service in honour of protestors who have died this week through the use of deadly force by the Yanukovych regime’s security forces.  The service will be on Sunday, January 26 at 11am at St Andrew’s Ukrainian Catholic Church on Church Street in Lidcombe.</p>
