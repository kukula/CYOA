<p> For Immediate release</p>
<p><strong>MEDIA RELEASE</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>SUBMISSION AND EVIDENCE PROVIDED TO PARLIAMENTARY HEARING ON OPENING AUSTRALIAN EMBASSY IN KYIV</p>
<p>Discussions with the Australian Government on opening an Embassy of Australia in Kyiv have recommenced.</p>
<p>On Friday February 17, 2012 the Chargé d'affaires of the Embassy of Ukraine in Canberra, Mr Stanislav Stashevskyi and Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) Chairman, Stefan Romaniw OAM, gave evidence at a Parliamentary Hearing of the Sub-Committee, (chaired by Mr. Nick Champion MP) of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>The Committee is chaired by Michael Danby MHR, who has been very supportive of the AFUO and Ukrainian issues. The Committee is currently gathering evidence on Australian Overseas Representation.</p>
<p>The AFUO provided a formal submission to the Committee in November 2011 (attached) as did the Embassy of Ukraine and was requested to appear before the Committee.</p>
<p>The AFUO argued that at post in Kyiv would open the region up to Australia and that Ukraine being the second most populated country in the region was an important catalyst in driving potential investment and business between Australia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inactivity in Ukraine by the Australian Government in the past has been a lost opportunity and that in the new order of global economics, markets such as Ukraine can bring new investments, new trade opportunities, opportunities for full fee paying students to come to Australia amongst other initiatives &quot; Mr Romaniw said</p>
<p>&ldquo;The AFUO also alluded to the fact that at times it plays the role of the Australian representative in Ukraine through its work with Ukraine -Australia House. Whilst NGO's can build bridges, they do not constitute formal representation.&rdquo; Mr Romaniw said</p>
<p>He also indicated that he has been given power of attorney for the International Confederation of Trade Unions in Ukraine and has also been empowered by the Chamber of Commerce and Business in Ukraine to seek opportunities between the two countries.  Both are also calling for formal Australian representation in Ukraine. This would assist them in creating greater bilateral business opportunities.</p>
<p>Mr. Stashevskyi pointed out that Australia was the only country in the G20 group without representation in Kyiv. He also stated that Ukraine is celebrating its 20 anniversary of formal diplomatic relations with Australia. This is evidence that Ukraine is serious about bilateral relations and opening a post in Kyiv would be an indication that Australia sees the potential in the region and recognises Ukraine as an international partner.</p>
<p>He also highlighted the fact that there is an active Ukrainian community in Australia and a post in Kyiv would create many opportunities for tourism to Australia, trade, cultural, educational and other exchanges.</p>
<p>Committee members asked a range of pertinent questions relating to business opportunities, immigration issues, bilateral potential and other matters</p>
<p>&ldquo;The AFUO calls on the Australian Government to open an Embassy in Kyiv. Given the strategic position of Ukraine in the region part of the responsibility for the Region should be passed onto Kyiv thereby opening greater opportunities for Australia not only in Ukraine but in the whole region.&rdquo; Mr Romaniw said</p>
<p>The AFUO believes opening a post in Kyiv would pay for itself in the short and medium term as new opportunities would see Australian business reaping the benefits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The AFUO also calls on DFAT and Austrade to ensure that any business delegation they take to Moscow should be briefed on the benefits of doing business with Ukraine and be encouraged to visit Ukraine whilst in that part of the world&rdquo; Mr Romaniw said</p>
<p>The AFUO will now continue to work with relevant decision makers in obtaining support for opening an Embassy in Kyiv.</p>
