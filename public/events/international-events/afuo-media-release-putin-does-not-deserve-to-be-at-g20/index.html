    <h1>PUTIN DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE AT G20</h1>

<p>The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) abhors the allowing of Vladimir Putin to the G20 Leaders Summit in Brisbane in November.</p>
<p>“In the future, world leaders will greatly regret appeasing Putin – the greatest threat to international order and prosperity and Western values. It is a huge mistake, as Putin has repeatedly shown that he will take a marathon when given a millimetre,” Mr Stefan Romaniw OAM, AFUO President, said.</p>
<pre><code>  * Mr Romaniw made the following points:
  * Putin has totally ignored the international community condemnation of Russian Federation aggression in Ukraine;
  * Forces backed and supplied by Putin are responsible for the loss of over 280 lives by shooting down in cold blood MH17, 28 of whose victims were Australians;
  * Putin and his supporters have challenged the international community by not allowing a free and independent inquiry into the MH17 disaster;
  * Putin has reminded the world of his potential to use nuclear weapons;
  * Putin's presence in Australia is a slap in the face for the families who lost their loved ones in MH 17 disaster.
</code></pre>
<p>“Given he has ignored or mocked all diplomatic entreaties to date, it is spin to suggest that the G20 is the right forum at which to make Putin accountable for his actions. All it does is legitimise Putin, rather than criticise him,” Mr Romaniw said.</p>
<p>“If someone suggests that the G20 is an economic forum, why admit as a peer someone who is acting against G20 aims by singlehandedly destroying the economy of his own country and neighbouring countries, and wielding gas supply as a political weapon.</p>
<p>“While the Australian Government may not have been successful so far in keeping him from the table, the Government is to be commended for its strong leadership position on Russian aggression in Ukraine and its strong condemnation of Putin and his followers in relation to the shooting down of MH17 and the interference in stopping the international investigation.</p>
<p>“The Government can now be consistent with its position to date by: continuing to lobby to exclude Putin from the G20 as happened with G8; calling on the other G20 members to declare their individual positions publicly, not collectively, and; considering its diplomatic right to declare Putin ‘persona non grata’ for entry purposes,” Mr Romaniw said.</p>
<p>The AFUO will:</p>
<pre><code>  * organise protest anti-Putin rallies together with other concered Australian community-based organisations;
  * work with the Ukrainian World Congress and its membership to lobby the leadership of other Governments involved in the G20 to reconsider their positions.
