    <h1>AUSTRALIAN OPEN 2011 – DOLGOPOLOV TO PLAY ON AUSTRALIA DAY</h1>
    
    <p>**“MARCHENKO GOES DOWN FIGHTING”
**Marchenko was always going to have the odds stacked against him as he faced Murray in Round 2 on Thursday night. But with an enthusiastic 30 odd Ukrainian supporters cheering him on, hopes were held high. In what was a gallant battle, Murray proved too good for the up and coming Ukrainian, smashing him in 3 sets, 6-1, 6-3, 6-3.</p>
<p>**“DAY 10 – ANOTHER UKRAINIAN FACES MURRAY!”
**After his sensational Round 3 upset against 13th seeded Jo-Wilfred Tsonga, Alexandr Dolgopolov continued his great form into Round 4 yesterday, undoing Robin Soderling (4) in  5 sets, 1-6, 6-3, 6-1, 4-6, 6-2.</p>
<p>Labelled as the ‘most unpredictable’ player in the Men’s singles tournament, Dolgopolov now faces in form, Andy Murray on Wednesday 26th Jan.
What better way to celebrate Australia day than getting down to Melbourne Park and supporting one of our own.</p>
<p>With the game most likely to be played on Rod Laver Arena, tickets are priced at approximately $129 each. However, whether it be a $29 ground pass or Rod Laver Ticket, it would be great to have a sea of Yellow and blue swarming through Melbourne Park.</p>
<p>** THIS IS ONCE AGAIN A MASS CALL OUT TO ALL UKRAINIAN SUPPORTERS TO COME DOWN TO MELBOURNE PARK TOMORROW, 26th January, 2011 AND SUPPORT ONE OF OUR OWN!</p>
<p>**Dolgopolov will need all the support he can get to make it through to the semis, so pack your picnic lunch and make a great day of it. More exact schedule details to come, stay tuned!</p>
<p>Once again, for any additional info, visit <a href="http://www.ozeukes.com/">www.ozeukes.com</a> or <a href="http://www.australianopen.com/">www.australianopen.com</a> </p>
<p>With ground passes at $29 per day and $20 after 5pm, gather your friends and family and get down to Melbourne Park!</p>
<p>See you on the court!
Yours in Sport,</p>
