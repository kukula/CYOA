    <h1>25th Anniversary of Ukrainian Independence Concert and Lunch - Perth</h1>
    
    <p>**Very special thanks to MZS (Ministry of Foreign Affairs – Ukraine) who has allocated USD $1,500 to CYOA to distribute to all Ukrainian Associations in Australia who staged an Independence Day Event. **</p>
<p>A very special day was celebrated with more than 110 people enjoying 25th Anniversary of Ukrainian Independence Concert.</p>
<p>The concert opened with a moving poen by Marichka Diachenko, “ Ya Ukrainochka” followed by the National Anthem.  The singing of the National Anthem of Ukraine at the start of the concert was met with exuberance and energy and I am sure our community will stay with this format for future concerts.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="http://www.ukrainiansinperth.com/ambassador-speech/">Ambassador Mykola Kulinich's Welcom</a><a href="http://www.ukrainiansinperth.com/#%21ambassador-speech/u4fq4">e</a> and the <a href="http://www.ukrainiansinperth.com/uawa-holova-speech/">UAWA President's speech</a><a href="http://www.ukrainiansinperth.com/#%21uawa-holova-speech/dg0a0"> </a>Perth’s younger dancing groups  Speka and Zahidni Zirky under the instruction of Tayissa Sweetlove  and Stephanie Parin entertained us with vibrant dancers. It is always great to see the younger ones perform.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian school students entertained us with poetry and songs (many thanks to our teachers Natalia Dotsyak and Natalka Holovina and Bohdan Mykytiuk).  For both Natalia Dotsyak and Natalka Holovina , our school teachers who have only started teaching this year, this was their first ever concert.   Natalka Holovina arrived from Ukraine in the last 6 months and has got passionately involved in our school as she wanted her daughter to continue her Ukrainian education.</p>
<p>We were privileged to hear two very special perfomances on piano, the first by Silvia Pekic who played a traditional Ukrainian melody “Oy ty divchyno zaruchenaya” and also Tatiana Syvak who played 2 moving pieces of music by Ukrainian composers Mykola Dremliuha “Liub-Neliub” (written on the theme of a Ukrainian song and game ) and Myroslav Skoryk , “Kolomiyka”.   I hope we will hear more of these talented ladies in future concerts. Tatiana Syvak is a graduate of the Kyiv Conservatory and now resides in WA, performing and teaching piano at all levels.</p>
<p>Of note were the addresses and the poem by Diana Teplyj (who was also our MC) which reminded us that whilst Ukraine has now reached 25 years of Independence her sovereignty and independence is still under threat by the fact that the Russian Federation continues the war in Eastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>Everyone was invited on stage and Fr Ihor Holovko, was invited to say a prayer for us and to Bless the Jubilee Torte and our lunch.  Again we were welcomed by a gastronomic delight when lunch was served.  Everyone enjoyed the excellent buffet, cakes and Jubilee Torte (donated by Mrs Stefania Melnyczuk &amp; Dr Lesa Melnyczuk). Thank you  Mike Cox and your staff from Acclaimed Catering (<a href="http://www.acclaimedcatering.com.au/">www.acclaimedcatering.com.au</a>)</p>
<p>The second part of the concert commenced with a presentation of a book by Lilia Shportko-McEwan on behalf of her daughter in Kyiv. The book was published in Kyiv, Ukraine and is called Mandarins it is written in both Ukrainian and English for younger readers and is available for sale.</p>
<p>Finally, we attempted (for the first time) to entertain young and old with riddles, musical chairs and even karaoke. Those that stayed had the opportunity to win cash prizes.  The prizes were as a result of a collection during lunch by the students.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the committee who contributed in setting up the hall. Thanks to Jamie Duff who manned the bar. Thanks to Roztiazhka Dancers for letting UAWA use their decorations which provided an awesome backdrop on the stage.</p>
<p>All in all – thanks to all of the performers and thanks to all who attended this year’s  25th Anniversary Independence Concert.</p>
