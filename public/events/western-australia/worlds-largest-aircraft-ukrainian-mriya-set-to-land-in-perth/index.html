<p>On Sunday 15 May at 10am (WST) the Antonov An-225 ‘Mriya’ will make its first-ever trip to Australia when it lands at Perth airport to deliver a generator weighing 130 tons.</p>
<p>Arriving at its final destination of a journey spanning three continents, the crew will be welcomed by Ukraine’s Ambassador to Australia, His Excellency Mykola Kulinich, and Chairman of the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) and General secretary of the Ukrainian World Congress, Mr. Stefan Romaniw OAM. The guests will also be given a traditional Ukrainian welcome of bread and salt by the Association of Ukrainians in Western Australia. (AUWA)</p>
<p>The visit is a sign of strengthening ties between Australia and Ukraine, a relationship forged in the aftermath of the MH17 tragedy in July 2014.</p>
<p>“This visit, together with the Uranium deal struck in April, signifies Australia’s growing relationship with Ukraine – a relationship that is mutually beneficial for each country,” said Mr. Romaniw.</p>
<p>The AFUO and the Embassy of Ukraine recently called on the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to continue building strategic alliances with Ukraine.</p>
<p>Key recommendations of the AFUO included ensuring the Embassy of Australia in Kyiv, Ukraine remains open, to work in partnership with Ukraine in the UN Security Council and to continue sanctions against the Russian Federation due to its ongoing illegal occupation of Crimea and aggression in Ukraine’s east.</p>
<p>The ‘Mriya’, meaning dream in Ukrainian, has pulled huge crowds at each of its stopovers including Prague, Czech Republic where it collected the generator, Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenistan and Hyderabad, India. A large contingent of aviation enthusiasts is expected in Perth to witness the impressive 1980s-built vessel.</p>
<p>The crew and guest will also attend a luncheon hosted by the AUWA represented by President Mykola Mowczan and Dnister Ukrainian Credit Cooperative represented by CEO Liam Tiernan.</p>
