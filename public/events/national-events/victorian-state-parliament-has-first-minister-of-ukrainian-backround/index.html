<p>&ldquo;Matthew's hard work, energy, commitment and tireless efforts have now been rewarded,&rdquo; AFUO Chairman Stefan Romaniw OAM said today</p>
<p>&ldquo;The community has watched Matthew grow into a formidable and mature politician, who has strong values and a culture of being focused on outcomes and encouraging others to be part of this process Matthew has been accessible and supportive in Opposition not only to our community but to the broader community&rdquo; Mr Romaniw said</p>
<p>&ldquo;His commitment to the Ukrainian community in Australia and Victoria in particular should be noted. Mr Romaniw said</p>
<p>Matthew received the President of Ukraine's Award for his services to Ukraine and the Ukrainian community from President Victor Yushchenko in 2009.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is an opportunity for Minister Guy to connect with a range of Members of Parliament in Canada and senior officials in other countries to form the first International MP's of Ukranian background group” , Mr Romaniw said</p>
