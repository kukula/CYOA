    <h1>Statement on misrepresentation and Fake News of AUC</h1>
    
    <p>As you may be aware there is a Facebook page of an unregistered person / structure calling itself the <strong><em>Australian Ukrainian Congress (AUC).</em></strong> A person associated with its postings is a failed Victorian politician named Andrew Olexander. Many of the posts are vile and full of vitriol. – with regular four-letter obscenities being posted.</p>
<p>The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) has avoided directly responding to the many false and unsubstantiated posts. The AFUO in its recent communiques signed by all AFUO member organisations stated that the community needs to be aware of groups purporting to be representative of a community. However FAKE NEWS from this outlet – AUC is prevalent and ongoing. The AUC has on a regular basis been exposed for spreading slanderous Fake News.</p>
<p>On two occasions AUC has tried to use our respected international community structures to indicate their connections - implying they are associated with the international community, which again is a lie.</p>
<p>The AFUO is now obliged to make a statement.</p>
<p>The AUC has blatantly lied and tried to associate itself with AFUO partners in the Ukrainian World Congress (UWC) namely the Ukrainian Canadian Congress (UCC) peak body for Ukrainians in Canada and Ukrainian Congress Committee of America (UCCA) – peak body for Ukrainians in the USA, implying the AUC is in some way associated with these bodies</p>
<p><strong>B_oth these organisations, in written statements, have totally refuted any knowledge or association with the AUC and have been clear in their strong relationship with the AFUO._</strong></p>
<p>Last night the AUC again tried to play this card of association with the UCCA – BUT HAS AGAIN BE EXPOSED FOR LYING</p>
<p>This morning the UCCA issued a Media Release - stating in part (full statement below)….<em>The reference to UCCA as a “supporter and friend” of the fake social media page “Australian Ukrainian Congress” in this context constituted a form of representation or statement which would express or imply endorsement by UCCA or any of its derivatives. As use of the terms “Ukrainian Congress Committee of America” and/or “UCCA” was not carried out by any UCCA officer or personnel, we agree with the assessment of many online that such a statement should be identified as “Fake News.” UCCA does not directly or indirectly endorse any product or service provided by the fake social media page “Australian Ukrainian Congress.”</em></p>
<p>In October 2018 the Ukrainian Canadian Congress issued a media release – <em>It’s come to our attention that a group called the Australian Ukrainian Congress is making claims to a connection with the Ukrainian Canadian Congress (UCC). We are not aware of this group or its leadership, and are concerned that they appear to be misrepresenting a connection to our organization. We are very proud to work with the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organizations (AFUO), through the Ukrainian World Congress, and note that they are the only recognized national member.</em></p>
<p>Whilst the AFUO has refrained from any direct response to the AUC page it is incumbent on the AFUO to state:</p>
<pre><code>  1. The AUC page does not reflect in anyway the Ukrainian community in Australia.
  2. Its posts are demeaning, they spread Fake news, and any implication of being associated with community structures in Australia or overseas is a total fabrication and falls very much into the category of FAKE NEWS.
  3. We thank our international partners and the community members in responding and exposing the blatant lies of the AUC and its fake news tactics.
</code></pre>
<p>Whilst the AFUO encourages community debate, discussion and appreciates opinions on how to better strengthen our community in Australia and to be criticised as there always other opinions – the AFUO. through consultation projects such as <em>The Way Forward Consultation Program</em> seeks broad community input (<a href="http://www.ozeukes.com/wayforward">www.ozeukes.com/wayforward</a>).</p>
<p>The AFUO condemns the AUC for its attempts in spreading Fake News, the use of vile language, its misrepresentation of information and its blatant lies in trying to associate itself with structures that have now totally and uncategorically refuted any association with AUC.</p>
<p>The Australian Ukrainian community and the international community are discerning and can filter right from wrong.</p>
<p>It has shown its unity and strength.</p>
<p>Fifth column activity then and now have been exposed and will always be exposed!</p>
