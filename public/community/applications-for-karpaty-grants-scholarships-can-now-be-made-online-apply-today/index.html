</a></p>
<p>** **The Board &amp; Trustees of The Karpaty Foundation have pleasure in announcing that Applications for Grants and Scholarships have now been enabled to be completed by editable text directly online. This will substantially simplify the operation and will no longer require an applicant to download the pdf form, complete it in hand-writing, scan and then forward it back to the Directors for review.</p>
<p>Applicants can now go directly to the web-page at <a href="https://www.scu.net.au/KarpatyFoundation">https://www.scu.net.au/KarpatyFoundation</a> and click on the link directly to the Grant Application or Scholarship Application, and complete the appropriate form by editable text.</p>
<p>Applicants are reminded that the next round of applications for <strong>grants closes at 5.00pm on Tuesday, 31 October 2017</strong>.  Late applications shall not be considered.</p>
<p>Scholarship Applications are normally considered in March, and must be lodged not late than 5.00PM on 28 February.  We advise that applicants for scholarships should consider their study requirements as early as possible and note, that courses at both the Ukrainian Catholic University and at the Kyiv Mohylanka Academy normally commence in the second half of the calendar year – applicants should lodge their applications prior to the closing date in the year they wish to take up study.</p>
<p>We also wish to advise that for the year 2018, the number of scholarships shall be limited to each of the above named institutions as follows:</p>
<pre><code>  * Summer courses at the Ukrainian Catholic University shall be limited to three  (3) annual scholarships which are available for a 3 week course at one of the 3 available sessions;
  * At the Kyiv Mohylanka Academy, one (1) annual scholarship is available at any selected course chosen by the applicant up to a value of $2,500 Australian dollars.
</code></pre>
<p>** **<strong>To date, the Board/Trustees have allocated over a quarter of a million dollars ($250,000+) for applicants to provide benefits to community and to promote and enhance a myriad of community projects as well as to provide opportunities to ensure the continued growth and maintenance of heritage, language and culture in a multicultural society afforded to us in Australia.</strong></p>
<p><strong>_The Board/Trustees wish to advise that the core funds currently held by the Foundation are not finite, and the initial $1 Million provided as a result of the merger between Karpaty Ukrainian and Sydney Credit Unions can be increased by direct donations or bequeaths to the Foundation. _</strong></p>
<p>**_ _****_Your support will allow the Foundation to provide even greater assistance to worthy community projects and to increase the level of scholarships benefiting students in the community to study in Ukraine. Should you wish to discuss this matter further please do not hesitate to contact a Director/Trustee at your convenience._**</p>
<p>**_ _****_Every dollar that the Foundation earns is spent on providing a benefit to an applicant towards a grant or for scholarship funding.  The only exception to this is the need to pay for compliance requirements (ie. Insurance, ASIC, and auditing). The Directors/Trustees are not paid nor reimbursed for any travel or accommodation costs and, provide their time totally on a voluntary basis._**</p>
<p>**_ _****_We especially call on the philanthropic minded members of the community, business owners and community organisations, who may wish to further enhance the core funds held by the Foundation to support the Foundation. The members of the Foundation are six of the major national community entities in Australia. These are: Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO); Ukrainian Women’s Association of Australia (UWAA); Ukrainian Youth Association of Australia (CYM – UYA); Plast Australia (Plast); the Eparchy of the Ukrainian Catholic Church in Australia; &amp; the Consistory of the Ukrainian Autocephalic Orthodox Church in Australia._**</p>
<p>**_ _****_The Foundation is truly representative of the core values of the Ukrainian community in Australia._**</p>
<p>The Karpaty Foundation was established to build a fair, just, creative and caring society, particularly in relation to the Ukrainian community in Australia and in Ukraine by,</p>
<pre><code>  * Enriching individual and civic life;
  * Improving the lives of people impoverished from social or cultural disadvantage;
  * Strengthening democratic values and participation;
  * Promoting creativity, innovation, tolerance, and the fulfilment of potential for the betterment and improvement of community values in society, with a focus on:
