<p>The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) mourns the passing of Patriarch Lubomyr Husar, former Head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, who passed away in Kyiv on May 31, 2017 aged 84.</p>
<p>Patriarch Husar was a spiritual leader not only for Ukrainian Catholics but for the Ukrainian Nation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His wise counsel was accepted by many as he steered his Church internationally. He also played a major in articulating the principles of fairness, justice, national identity and encouraging the Ukrainian Nation to stay strong and focused in in its struggles. God has guided Ukraine and will continue to do so was his mantra,&rdquo; AFUO Chairman Stefan Romaniw said today.</p>
<p>He was responsible for cementing the UGCC in Ukraine after years of persecution by the Soviet Regime. He ultimately brought the Chair of the Church firstly to Lviv and finally to Kyiv.</p>
<p>He visited his flock throughout the world including Australia.</p>
<pre><code>  * Born in Lviv, Husar fled with his parents in 1944 during World War II. They briefly lived in Salzburg, Austria, then emigrated to the United States in 1949.
  * Although once a citizen of the United States, Husar gave up his American citizenship upon returning to his native Ukraine.
  * From 1950 to 1954 he studied at St. Basil College Seminary in Stamford, Connecticut. He studied at The Catholic University of America and Fordham University in the United States, and was ordained a priest on 30 March 1958 for the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Stamford.
  * He was consecrated a bishop in 1976 in the Castel Gandolfo chapel by Major Archbishop Josyf Slipyj without papal permission (apostolic mandate) in an act which caused many irritations in the Roman Curia.
  * He was named Archimandrite (Archabbot) of the Studite Monks in Europe and America in 1978. Was elected by the Synod of Bishops of the Ukrainian Church as exarch of the archiepiscopal exarchy of Kyiv and Vyshhorod in 1995.
  * In December 2000, Pope John Paul II named Husar apostolic administrator of the Ukrainian Greek Major-Archeparchy of Lviv.
  * January 2001 the Ukrainian Greek synod elected him Major Archbishop.
  * 21 February 2011 Pope John Paul II created and proclaimed Husar Cardinal-Priest of Santa Sofia a Via Boccea.
  * Also at that conclave, Cardinal Husar was the first Major-Archbishop from the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church ever to participate in a papal conclave as cardinal-elector.
  * The major archiepiscopal see of Lviv was moved on 21 August 2005, to the city of Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine.
  * With failing eyesight forcing him to perform the church's intricate liturgical rites from memory, his early resignation was accepted on 10 February 2011.
  * Cardinal Husar's resignation triggered a meeting of the Synod of the Ukrainian church.
  * Sviatoslav Shevchuk was selected on 23 March and confirmed by Pope Benedict XVI on 25 March 2011. Patriarch Husar remained a major influence by providing advice to the new Church leadership.
</code></pre>
<p>He was a major spiritual leader during the Revolution of Dignity. Patriarch Husar was later a lead spokesperson for the group known as December 1, a group of distinguished statesmen in Ukraine whose advice was sought by many.</p>
<p>The AFUO extends its sympathy to the leadership of the UGCC, its leader Patriarch Sviatoslav Shevchuk, the Bishops, clergy and laity. We also extend our sympathy to Bishop Peter Stasiuk the Head of the UGCC in Australia and clergy and laity in Australia.</p>
<p>Patriarch Lubomyr was strong and dedicated spiritual and national leader. He will be sadly missed.May he rest in peace</p>
<p>May he rest in peace.</p>
