<p><strong><em>MEDIA RELEASE</em></strong></p>
<h3 id="april-26-2016---30th-anniversary-of-the-chornobyl-disaster">April 26, 2016 - 30th anniversary of the  Chornobyl Disaster</h3>
<p>Light a Candle in memory</p>
<p>Today, 26 April 2016 marks the 30th Anniversary of Chornobyl Nuclear Disaster in Ukraine, one of the worst nuclear disasters in history, which took the lives of people at the time and continues to impact heavily on the lives of thousands now. Long term illnesses, deformities, wasted land radioactively contaminated, no go zones are now the norm for many.</p>
<p>The Kremlin at that time through its total disregard for humanity defied making announcements and reports and even continued with May Day marches through the streets of Ukraine as if nothing happened.</p>
<p>At a community commemoration in Melbourne this week former Chornobyl liquidator Serhij Bucharenko, who was one of many charged months later with the responsibility of stopping the leaks at the Reactor said that impact on people’s lives was horrific.</p>
<p>“Its 30 years on and I have had 3 operations, constant pain, loss of vision. I have daily reminders. We must remember the 28 who perished on that day, their families and thousands effected, the mothers, the children, the fathers who live with reminders of this catastrophe and will for the rest of their lives. We must not allow the world to forget” Serhij Bucharenko said.</p>
<p>The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) welcomes the initiative of Ukraine to establish the Chornobyl Special Biosphere Reserve that will preserve the natural state of the environment, allow for rehabilitation of the affected areas, and further international research</p>
<p>The AFUO calls on the Ukrainian Community and the broader Australian community to light a candle today in memory of those who died and to support the many thousands still effected.</p>
<p>“Three decades of suffering have already passed. The Chornobyl disaster is a human tragedy that will live with us for generations. It must be a reminder how precious human life is and we must never allow a disaster of this magnitude to occur again” AFUO Chairman Stefan Romaniw said.</p>
