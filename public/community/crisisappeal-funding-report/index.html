<h3 id="-background-for-the-first-stage-of-funding-">_Background for the first stage of funding: _</h3>
<p>In 2018, $128,000 AUD was raised by the fund. This enabled the Veteran Program to support 25 Veterans and their families (approximately 100 people) on the journey for a better life. With the aim of a holistic care program, an in depth assessment was completed by Caritas Ukraine qualified case workers to identify each of the Veterans specific needs. These_ otherwise would not have been fulfilled _due to financial circumstances, ineligibility for support from the state, as well as the lack of specialised treatment in their cities or villages.</p>
