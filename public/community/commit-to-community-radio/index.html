</a>Radio 3ZZZ is the largest ethnic community station in Australia, broadcasting in many languages, including Ukrainian.  The radio station’s management is raising awareness about the migration of broadcasting to digital radio and is concerned about the impact on community radio stations.  It is seeking the support of the whole radio community, including the signing of a petition.  Radio 3ZZZ has published the following appeal:</p>

<p><strong>COMMIT TO COMMUNITY RADIO!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Broadcasters and Friends of 3ZZZ Ethnic Community Radio,</p>
<p>The future of 3ZZZ and community radio in general is at risk. The future of free-to-air broadcasting is digital radio, and community radio can't afford to be left behind.</p>
<p>The Government has committed $2.2 million per year to community digital radio for four years (2012-2016) but a minimum of $3.6 million per year is required to maintain the current community digital radio services in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth.</p>
<p>We need the Government to commit to the $1.4 million per year shortfall in funding in the next federal budget. If not, the number of community digital radio services currently on air will have to be substantially reduced. One scenario would require all services in Melbourne and one other capital city to be switched off. This will include the digital services which 3ZZZ is developing.</p>
<p>Commercial Radio Australia is already quoting 2021 (only 8 years away) as a possible switch-off date for analog broadcast services, so the need for community radio to make its way on to the digital platform is absolutely essential for guaranteeing the sector a broadcast future. If Analog is switched off and Community Radio has not transferred to Digital then we will switch off as well. Can you imagine your communities without 3ZZZ to serve them, to provide information, to entertain and to assist in settlement and cohesion of new comers to Australia.</p>
<p>Millions of Australians (in fact, a quarter of all Australians) listen to community radio every week. 3ZZZ, along with the other 36 community broadcasters with digital access, are launching a campaign today. We're asking listeners and community radio supporters to sign a petition online and commit to community radio - we need your names on the petition and your support in getting word out. Please go online at <a href="http://committocommunityradio.org.au">committocommunityradio.org.au</a> and sign the petition and urge your listeners, community members and friends to as well.</p>
<p>This is very serious and we could end up without 3ZZZ unless we all act now!</p>
