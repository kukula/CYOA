<p>Victor’s wife, Marijka and his children Juliana and Timothy were present as well as Bishop Peter Stasiuk, who represented the Ukrainian community at the event.</p>
<p>After the ceremony Bishop Peter congratulated and thanked both Victor and Marijka on this award because he recognized that Herculean effort of support from the Rudewych family over the years has been a family effort. Victor was recognized by the Governor for “service to the Ukrainian Community of Victoria.”</p>
