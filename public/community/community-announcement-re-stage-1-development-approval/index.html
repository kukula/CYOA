<p>Members of Victoria’s and the broader Australian Ukrainian communities would be aware that the <strong>Association of Ukrainians in Victoria (AUV) is undertaking an exciting new project of redeveloping the AUV-owned properties in Russell Street, Essendon.</strong> The Chairman and Directors of the AUV are pleased to announce that on 31st December 2015, the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) determined that <strong>a permit for the application should be granted by Moonee Valley Council for the first stage of the redevelopment</strong>, which consists of 94 apartments over 10 levels with ground floor retail and roof top terrace.</p>
<p>The <strong>President of the AUV, Mr Michael Moravski</strong> stated: “The primary rationale for the redevelopment is to maximise the value of the real estate and to create an income-generating model, the proceeds of which will be used to fund the future activities of the Association for its members, as well as for the betterment of the Ukrainian community in Victoria as a whole.”</p>
<p><strong>The Stage 1 Development encompasses the properties located at 13-21 Russell Street</strong> (including ‘Dim Molodi’). With the application now approved, the developers will create a schedule for the demolition and construction phases, due to commence later on this year.</p>
<p><strong>AUV Building Committee Chairman, Mr Ross Merunovich</strong>, said “This is one of the most ambitious and most important projects ever undertaken by the AUV. It will lay the foundations for further activities and development of the AUV and Victoria’s Ukrainian community. It will also be a major facelift project for the local area.”</p>
<p>Over coming months a sales office, including building model, display kitchen and bathroom will be established in the front section of the AUV Ukrainian House. The model will be available for inspection by prospective buyers, as well as AUV members. We will aim to have a special pre-release for interested members, family and friends.</p>
