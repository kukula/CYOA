“Club Wise Ones” monthly catch up happened on Saturday the 9th of August at 7pm at DYM.</p>
<p>This gathering was sprinkled with a touch of our Ukrainian Heritage</p>
<p>Even though the club is based on no rules, club members have chosen to theme this gathering with a “Touch of Ukraine” to celebrate our heritage in the month that</p>
<p>we also commemorate ‘Ukraine’s Independence “. So we invite &amp; encourage everyone to add a touch of something Ukrainian to their attire as well as bring along a Ukrainian delicacy to share.</p>
<p>At the last gathering some wise ones indicated what delight they are sharing, so to make it easier for you to make your choice a list is attached of what has already been offered, however if you would like to bring along the same delicacy that is fine .</p>
<p>The group enjoys new members each month and we hope that this continues, so we encourage each of our members to bring along a couple of extra friends this month so the club continues to expand.</p>
<p>As always “New members” will be greeted with a glass of “Wise Ones” port ( generously provided by Olga &amp; Peter Chochula) &amp; a happy snap for the album.</p>

<p>Pryvit,</p>
<h2 id="club-wise-ones-is-all-about-us">&ldquo;Club Wise Ones&rdquo; ?&hellip;&hellip;.is all about….. us!</h2>
<p>Us&hellip;&hellip;who are now sharing our knowledge and experiences with the next generation, supporting and patting them on the back for their passion and continuation of assuring our uki community stays strong, vibrant and united.</p>
<p>Us&hellip;.. who now together share our memories, successes, life friendships, war stories and for some ….. the newly acquired aches &amp; pains.</p>
<p>Us&hellip;.. whose lives are so busy that catching up with friends is often challenging - Hence the reason for the formation of</p>
<p>&ldquo;Club Wise Ones&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li>The aim: To facilitate us getting together regularly just to enjoy each other's company and share a few laughs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Uprava of CYM have been kind enough to offer our Uki home &ldquo;DYM&rdquo; as our function centre, with the only restriction being that we leave it neat, tidy and replace anything that we use.</p>
<p>The club gets together the 2nd Saturday of each month and we are thrilled that each get together we welcome more new members.</p>
<p>WHAT TO BRING:</p>
<ul>
<li>A smile</li>
<li>A perekuska to share ( savory or sweet )</li>
<li>Beverages of choice</li>
<li>Friends that you would like to share the evening with
RULES OF ENGAGEMENT:</li>
<li>No one is the president</li>
<li>There is no committee</li>
<li>No one is the organizer</li>
<li>We all share the set up and clean up</li>
<li>We all take responsibility for having a good time</li>
<li>No invitations or RSVP’s are required to club events- all are welcome</li>
<li>If we have missed some one on the initial or sequential club emails, your responsibility is to explain that “the email list is not selective but is what we have available and that they should come along if they want to enjoy your company”.</li>
<li>Your suggestions
PARKING:
The DYM car park will be available but has limited spaces, the driveway entrance being closed will indicate that the car park is full and you need to find alternate parking.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions please feel free in this instance to give me a call on 0417 237 938.</p>
<p>See you Saturday evening.</p>
