<p>MEDIA UPDATE</p>
<p>AUSTRALIAN PROTESTERS SAY TO G20:
STOP PUTIN OR SURRENDER WORLD ORDER</p>
<p>Anti-Putin protestors will gather in Brisbane’s CBD to send two messages: Australians oppose Putin’s ‘tyrant tyranny’ and G20 Leaders must choose to protect the world from his further aggression.</p>
<p>The Protest Against Putin will be on Saturday, November 15 at 1pm to 2.30pm at King George Square outside Brisbane City Hall. The peaceful protest will include Australians of many backgrounds, community speakers and street theatre, and is in full cooperation with Queensland Police.</p>
<p>Stefan Romaniw OAM, President of the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO), said:</p>
<p>“We say to Putin: we democratic Australians are disgusted by your presence in Australia. We condemn your tyrant terrorism – be it your invasions of smaller countries, your responsibility for those who destroyed MH17 and took Australian lives, your provocative naval activity and your disregard for human rights.</p>
<p>“We say to G20 Leaders: you have a clear choice. You can stand up to Putin and secure international norms or you can bow to his dangerous plan to destroy the principles of democracy – and the lives that will cost.</p>
<p>“Putin’s aggression - including a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine - will continue if he is not strongly stopped. After that, who will be next?</p>
<p>“Everyday, Putin shows he has his own authoritarian rules – not those of the international community. For it’s own sake and safety, the international community needs to bring him to heel.</p>
<p>“Putin’s neo-Soviet domination plan is a new and unprecedented risk based on old KGB tactics. The international community’s response needs to be new, unprecedented and based on the strong stance that won the Cold War.</p>
<p>“G20 Leaders have a stark and historically vital choice between allowing Putin’s dictatorship to dominate or standing strong in the name of democracy and human and national rights. Don’t get it wrong as there are thousands of lives in the balance.”</p>
