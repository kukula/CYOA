<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p><strong>AUSTRALIA-UKRAINE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TO OPEN IN KYIV</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://aucc.biz/">Australia-Ukraine Chamber of Commerce</a> will be fully operational by the end of 2015 to pursue business opportunities between Australia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>According to the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO), who have initiated the project, Dr. Petro Matiaszek, a lawyer who has a 20 year long background in Ukraine’s corporate and public affairs spheres, will act as the Kyiv-based President of the Australia-Ukraine Chamber of Commerce, and Pete Shmigel will be its Sydney-based Interim Chair.</p>
<p>Stefan Romaniw, AFUO President, said the following in Kyiv today: “The Australia-Ukraine Chamber of Commerce is a vital step for Australia-Ukraine ties. It will become a key facilitator for Australian businesses seeking opportunities in Ukraine and vice versa. It will help grow the current $150 million trade relationship for the benefit of both countries. It will support the new Australian Embassy in its trade work in any way that it can.”</p>
<p>“We believe there is every reason to be confident about Australia-Ukraine business ties because Ukraine features high education and skill levels, good English levels, extremely competitive cost and labour structures, a strong resource base, and strong international support for a peaceful future,” Mr Romaniw said.</p>
<p>Dr Matiaszek said: “A reformist administration in Ukraine understands the need for business engagement, transparency, and policy certainty, and the doors are now open to a wide range of trade and investment opportunities between Australia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Market feedback suggests many potential areas of mutual benefit such as: international education; aviation; aerospace; mining services; resources including manganese, gas and uranium; FMCG; hospitality; fashion; outsourcing of services and manufacturing; agriculture including beef and honey, as well as IP / governance systems.</p>
<p>“The current period shows just how resilient and innovative Ukrainian business is and smart investors currently have abundant, low-barrier opportunities for future realisation,” Dr. Matiaszek said.</p>
<p>Mr Romaniw, Dr. Matiaszek and Sydney-based, Ukraine-born research analyst Kateryna Kharovska will this week be in Kyiv to brief Australian and Ukrainian Government officials and business contacts on the new development. An inaugural business roundtable will be held on Sunday night in Kyiv – with Ambassador Doug Trappett as special guest – to discuss opportunities.</p>
<p>A key milestone for the newly initiated Australia-Ukraine Chamber of Commerce will be organising a business delegation exchange in later 2015 and successfully advocating visa reform for travel between Australia and Ukraine.</p>
