<p><strong>MEDIA RELEASE</strong></p>
<p>ACTION CONTINUES IN KYIV CALLING FOR UKRAINE TO WITHDRAW WTO ACTIONS AGAINST AUSTRALIA ON TOBACCO ISSUE</p>
<p>A rally held outside the Cabinet of Ministers in Kyiv yesterday called on the Ukrainian Government to withdraw from proceedings against Australia at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in relation to tobacco and cigarette packing.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Arseniy Yatsenyuk yesterday also called for a halt to the actions demanding that this matter be resolved immediately.</p>
<p>The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) has called for transparency and for government officials supporting the continuation of the action at the WTO to declare their interest /conflict of interest. Attached are the demands of Organisations in Ukraine naming officials who appear to have an interest in the matter.</p>
<p>AFUO President Stefan Romaniw raised WTO issue with President Poroshenko during his Australian visit last year and again in February this year with the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Verchovna Rada headed by Hanna Hopko, who has since investigated this matter and supported the AFUO position.</p>
<p>The matter was raised again recently by the AFUO in Kyiv in meetings with the Deputy Head of the President’s Administration Valerij Charlyj, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Vadym Prystaiko , Cabinet Ministers and the Ukraine Australia Parliamentary Friendship Committee .</p>
<p>“The AFUO maintains that the Australian Government has been very supportive of Ukraine in its time of crisis - Russian aggression in the East, the call for an international investigation into the MH17 disaster, actioning sanctions against the Russian Federation. Ukraine should now reciprocate and withdraw the absurd action in the WTO” Mr Romaniw said</p>
<p>The AFUO extends its gratitude to all who continue to highlight this issue and insist on stopping the WTO action and thus building stronger ties between Ukraine and Australia.</p>
