    <h1>Human Rights in Ukraine are Being Violated-Australian Government Must Become Watchdog</h1>
    
    <p>Human and national rights in Ukraine are being violated by the current pro Russian President Yanukovych regime.</p>
<p>This is the message the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) will be relaying  to the Australian Government and calling on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to express Australia's concerns at these violations . Australia should send a strong note warning  We will monitor human and national rights in Ukraine .</p>
<p>Similar requests for assistance will be sent to Amnesty International and other major organisations</p>
<p>Yesterday, September 8, 2010 another major incident saw the unprecedented detention by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) of historian and director of the National Museum and Memorial to the Victims of the Occupation Regime  &ldquo;Turma  Lontskoho&rdquo; in Lviv  together with Ruslan Zabily  and the illegal removal of his personal effects, psychological pressure and threats. Zabily was interrogated by SBU agents for over 14 hours without the right of legal advocates or assistance .</p>
<p>The SBU today also forced the closure of the Museum and  forbidding  its historians and researchers  to go about their work.</p>
<p>This disregard and denial of human rights and stifling of national interests by President Yanukovych's  Administration is becoming more prevalent . The SBU has systematically commenced actions  to pressure and stifle Ukrainian national revival and those in Ukraine who promote it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a gross systematic violation of human rights which contravenes the values set out in The International Universal Declaration of Human Rights &ldquo;AFUO Chairman Mr Stefan Romaniw said today</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is time to act now - The Australian and other  democratic Governments must focus on these issues now.  Australian media must focus on Ukraine and do investigative journalism. We need to expose these violations .&rdquo; Mr Romaniw said</p>
<p>The Australian Government should send a stern diplomatic note warning the Ukrainian Government that the world is watching. any forcing of pro Russian position in Ukraine must not be allowed to ferment.</p>
<p>This follows a spate of incidences such as the  recent heavy handed visit by SBU agents   to the Ukrainian  Catholic  University  in Lvov and its rector Father Borys Gudziak which attracted international attention.  Fr Gudziak recently visited Australiana nd spoke about his experiences  . Currently an outspoken Kharkiv editor is missing feared dead because of his work fighting corruption and supporting national identity.</p>
