<p><strong>THE WEST NEEDS TO WAKE UP TO PUTIN’S INVASION</strong></p>
<p>As the Russian Federation’s troops and tanks enter Ukraine in unprecedented numbers, the West must overcome ‘Ukraine-fatigue’ and act with purpose, according to the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO).</p>
<p>Mr Stefan Romaniw OAM, President of the AFUO, said:</p>
<p>“Putin is betting on western democracies having short attention spans and weak commitment to their own values.  If the West nods off, Putin will occupy Ukraine and achieve his goal of ‘NovoRossiya’, the restoration of the Russian empire, which is a direct threat to the West.</p>
<p>“With some 9000 Russian Federation regular troops, including special forces earlier this week at Donetsk airport, recently deployed into Ukraine, it is the time for the West to hear the alarm, keep its promises and help the Ukrainians defend themselves.</p>
<p>“There are a range of treaties and laws that are meant to see the West support Ukraine’s independence and territorial sovereignty, but to date assistance has been very limited.</p>
<p>“These agreements were made because the West recognised the threat that an expansionist Russian Federation poses to the West, and because they enshrined Western democratic values.</p>
<p>“By not acting on its own obligations and interests, the West opens the door for Putin to soon mount a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and cause the loss of thousands of innocent lives.</p>
<p>“It is good to recently see the next tranche of Australian non-lethal military support flowing to Ukraine, including clothing and field equipment.  Now, as raised during the visit of the President of Ukraine to Australia, it is appropriate for the Abbott Government to continue leading and provide direct logistical and medical assistance that can save lives, such as hi-tech radar equipment and medical evacuation vehicles and aircraft.</p>
<p>“US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power is right to call what’s happening in Ukraine right now ‘Russia’s occupation plan’. Deeds need to now follow words and the West needs to help defend Ukraine.”</p>
