<h3 id="we-must-not-allow-it-to-fall-off-the-radar">WE MUST NOT ALLOW IT TO FALL OFF THE RADAR</h3>
<p>The Australian Ukraine community continues to mourn the 38 Australians who were murdered over Ukraine on July 17, 2014, when flight MH17 was shot down by Russian forces.</p>
<p>The families of the dead still grieve – and still have no answers.</p>
<p>No one has taken responsibility for the act of international terrorism. But neither does anybody doubt who is to blame.</p>
<p>The rebels who brought down Malaysian Airlines MH17 were sponsored and equipped by Moscow as part of Russia’s brutal and illegal annexation of Crimea.</p>
<p>There were 298 people on board the Boeing 777 which was flying at 32,000 feet over the village of Snizhne when it was brought down by a Russian-built Buk surface-to-air missile launcher which had been smuggled across the border.</p>
<p>No one survived.</p>
<p>The missile launcher was just one weapon in a range of heavy artillery supplied to the rebels from Moscow.</p>
<p>The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations awaits the findings of the official Netherlands investigation of the tragedy – Russia is not cooperating with Dutch prosecutors – and continues to call for an international tribunal to deal with perpetrators.</p>
<p>“Two years on Russian aggression in Ukraine continues, and Russian President Vladimir Putin flaunts the Minsk Agreements and UN Resolution 68/262 that affirmed Crimea is part of Ukraine.” Stefan Romaniw OAM Chairman of AFUO said.</p>
<p>“July 17 is a time to remind the Australian Government and other world leaders of Russia’s bloody seizure of Crimea.</p>
<p>It is also the time for the civilised world to agree on strong sanctions against Mr Putin and to mobilise peace-keeping forces to protect Ukrainians from Russia’s illegal expansion.” Mr Romaniw said.</p>
<p>The AFUO extends its sympathy to the families of those murdered on that horrific day and calls on Australian Government to continue to show support for Ukraine.</p>
<p>Requiem services will be held in Ukrainian churches throughout Australia on Sunday July 17, 2016 to pray for those who lost their lives on MH17.</p>
