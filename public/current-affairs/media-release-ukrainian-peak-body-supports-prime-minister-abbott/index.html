<p><strong>MEDIA RELEASE</strong></p>
<p>** **</p>
<p><strong>UKRAINAN PEAK BODY SUPPORTS PRIME MINISTER ABBOTT</strong></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Let me conclude with this, the bullying of small countries by big ones, the trampling of justice and decency in the pursuit of national aggrandisement and reckless indifference to human life should have no place in our world.&rdquo; – Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon. Tony Abbott MP (July 18, Canberra, Australia)</em></p>
<p>The peak body for the Ukrainian community in Australia says that the appropriate stance by Prime Minister Tony Abbott in response to MH17 is being strongly acknowledged in Ukraine and is a good model for world leaders.</p>
<p>Mr Stefan Romaniw OAM, President of the AFUO, said:</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister’s strong leadership with regard to MH17 is what this horrible situation calls for. His example has been warmly welcomed in Ukraine, and other world leaders would do well to join him in strongly standing up against Vladimir Putin for justice, security and territorial sovereignty.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister has very appropriately called for adherence to international norms: an independent international investigation of MH17 and respect for the sovereignty of Ukraine as an independent country.</p>
<p>“That the Russian Federation finds this ‘unacceptable’ further shows Vladimir Putin has absolutely no respect for international norms.</p>
<p>“Participation in the international community, including forums such as G20, means acceptance of its norms, including responsibility for one’s actions. By not supporting an unconditional investigation and by continuing to deny his aggressive actions in eastern Ukraine, Putin is ignoring his responsibilities.</p>
<p>“All evidence thus far points to so-called pro-Russian separatists – better termed ‘tyrant terrorists’ – as having shot down MH17 and taken the lives of 28 Australians. They could only have down this with sophisticated weaponry provided by Putin’s regime.</p>
<p>“Those who ignore international norms and foster ‘tyrant terrorism’ cannot legitimately pursue or benefit from the prosperity goals of the G20, and it is likely that Putin would be made most unwelcome by the Australian community.</p>
<p>“Putin doesn’t belong at G20 and Australians would not want him there.</p>
<p>“If Putin wants to come to G20 and has nothing to hide, it will both support the independent inquiry advocated by the Prime Minister through the UN Security Council, will facilitate full access to the crash site, which is held by forces supported by the Russian Federation, will help bring the terrorists who shot down the plane to justice, and will stop the violence in eastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>The AFUO also acknowledges the strong bi-partisan support and steadfast position provided by the Leader of the Opposition.</p>
