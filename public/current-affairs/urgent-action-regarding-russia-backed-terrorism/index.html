 24 July 2014</p>
<p>** His Excellency Tony Abbott**
** Prime Minister of Australia**
** G20 President**</p>
<p>Parliament House
Canberra ACT 2600
Australia</p>
<p>Dear Prime Minister:</p>
<p>** Re: Urgent action regarding Russia-backed terrorism**</p>
<p>****On behalf of the Ukrainian World Congress and the Ukrainian diaspora, please accept our condolences following the tragic deaths of some 30 Australian citizens and residents on Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17. It is an unspeakable loss for your nation.</p>
<p>We acknowledge and commend the leadership position taken by yourself, your Minister for Foreign
Affairs Julie Bishop, and your Government in response to the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight
MH17, including initiating and steering the UN Security Council resolution of 21 July 2014. The clarity
and strength of your position has guided the international community’s response, and is in part a fitting
tribute to those who perished during this horrific act of terrorism.</p>
<p>In light of the above, the Ukrainian World Congress hereby seeks your further action as G20 President. As you know, over the past months, the international community has witnessed Russia’s brazen violations of international law with its:</p>
<pre><code>  1. illegal annexation of Crimea;
  2. persistent support of violent terrorist activities in Eastern Ukraine; and
  3. assistance for the shootdown of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 and subsequent obstruction at gunpoint of the investigation at the crash site.
</code></pre>
<p>The downing of a passenger airliner that killed 298 people from various countries should be a chilling
warning to the international community of the consequences of tolerating Russia-backed terrorism
and unabashed violations of the territorial integrity of an independent country.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Ukrainian World Congress urges you, as the current G20 President, to take the necessary measures to end President Vladimir Putin’s reign of terror that is threatening the world by calling on the G20 Leaders to immediately:</p>
<pre><code>  1. impose targeted sector-specific sanctions (third level sanctions) against Russia;
  2. provide military aid to Ukraine in order to remove the menace to the international community posed by Russia-backed terrorists in Eastern Ukraine;
  3. deny Russia’s President Vladimir Putin the privilege of participating in the upcoming G20 Leaders Summit on 15 and 16 November 2014 in Brisbane, Queensland; and
  4. invite Ukraine’s President Petro Poroshenko to attend the G20 Leaders Summit in Australia.
</code></pre>
<p>If the G20 Leaders do not act promptly and decisively, Russia will be emboldened to further threaten peace and security, not only in Ukraine, but throughout the world, bringing even more suffering and death of innocent people.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>UKRAINIAN WORLD CONGRESS
Eugene Czolij
