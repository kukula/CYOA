    <h1>Open Letter from Ukrainians in Australia opposing conversation event with Ambassador of Russia in Perth.</h1>
    
    <p>Three Open Letters from the Ukrainian Association of Western Australia , Dr Lesa Melnyczuk and the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations to the PROPOSED EVENT IN WA, A Conversation with the Russian Ambassador to Australia</p>
<p>To:</p>
<p>Curtin Alumni</p>
<p>Curtin Media Officers</p>

<p>YOUNG AUSTRALIANS in INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS</p>
<p>How quickly we forget the atrocities that Russia has promulgated?</p>
<p>How quickly we forget the &ldquo;tongue lashing&rdquo; that Julie Bishop (then the Foreign Minister) served up to the Russian Ambassador G Logvinov (Ref. <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/2018/03/28/julie-bishop-grigory-logvinov-tv/">https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/2018/03/28/julie-bishop-grigory-logvinov-tv/</a>)</p>
<p>How quickly we forget MH17 and the 298 lives (38 of whom were Australian; 3 from West Australia)</p>
<p>Australia has not even started to see and realise what devastation Russia has carried out, and continues execute to this day in Ukrainian Crimea. Crimea was annexed in February 25, 2014. The Crimean Tatar population has been decimated by the Soviet State on the orders of Stalin since 1944 and  recommenced on Crimea's annexation in 2014.</p>
<p>One month after the Crimean annexation the Russian forces started their campaign in Donetsk and Luhansk (eastern provinces of Ukraine).</p>
<p>The fighting in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region is now entering its fifth year. More than 10,000 people have been killed in this persistent conflict; 2,800  civilians. Nearly two million people have been internally displaced or put at risk if they remain in their homes.  Today, the Donbas war is among the worst humanitarian crises in the world, with frequent attacks occurring from both sides across the oblasts (provinces) of Donetsk and Luhansk. Before the war, this compact, heavily urbanized and industrialized region held nearly 15 percent of Ukraine’s population (6.6 million) and generated 16 percent of its gross domestic product. Today it is a humanitarian disaster area. (Ref.</p>

<p>Let me also remind you about the lecture Battlefield Ukraine: The Future of East-West Strategic Relations in the Context of the Crisis in Crimea presented by Dr Alexey D. Muraviev on Wednesday 21 May 2014. The Ukrainian community of Perth who attended this lecture were left shocked by the bias of a Curtin professor who did not even mingle after the event.</p>
<p>I may also remind the readers of the atrocities of 1932-1933 of the Holodomor (extermination by hunger) perpetuated by Stalin against the Ukrainian population and that in Nov 2013 a motion was passed in the Australia Senate and Australia recognised this heinous crime perpetuated against the Ukrainian nation where up to ten million innocent men, women and children died an agonising and unnecessary death.</p>
<p>Australia gave shelter and hope to hundreds of thousands of refugees offering them hope from their ravaged homelands however in this the eighty fifth year of the commemoration of the Holodomor and this the seventieth year of the immigration of Ukrainians to Australia, Ukrainians are again aghast that the agents of those that promote the act of war (past and present), perpetuated the Holodomor of 32-33, shot down MH17 and continue to promote global unrest be permitted to perpetuate their darkness, their truth and incite our youth&hellip;</p>
<p>Fascinating that light travels about 150 million kilometres from the sun to our planet and yet you alone can stop it reaching the earth. Your shadow is that proof.</p>
<p>Is this what real democracy really represents - a presentation of a one sided viewpoint?</p>
<p>I beseech each and everyone reading this letter to not be the shadow that denies the truth to be heard and seen.</p>
<p>If you permit the Russian Ambassador, Mr Grigory Logvinov to talk about the Russian view of the world today&hellip; you must also permit someone from Ukraine to offer a balancing view, otherwise, respectfully we request that this event be scrapped.</p>
<p>It is also distressing to see the West Australian Multicultural Association promoting this event,  they don't seem to realise that Multiculturalism should be promoting peace and harmony and not political events.</p>
<p>Respectfully</p>
<p>Mykola Mowczan</p>
<p>President</p>
<p>Ukrainian Association of Western Australia</p>
<p><strong>OPEN LETTER</strong></p>
<p>Fellow Western Australians,</p>
<p>I am offended that this event is being staged in my state and my Alma Mater.</p>
<p>Given the ridiculous edicts from the Kremlin over many issues that have occurred in the last decade, this will be a Russian fest of sycophants.</p>
<p>When any Russian diplomat can adequately deal appropriately and honestly with the downing of MH17, the war in east Ukraine, Crimea and other world territories, poisoning/executions on countries’ sovereign soil  and starving millions of Ukrainians without any historical regress, then a possible conversation may occur.</p>
<p>I don’t hold my breath.</p>
<p>Russian terrorism holds no bars and as migrant children escaping the tyranny of Russian cruelty and who were lucky to migrate to Western Australia 70 years ago, ours and other migrants pioneers should be respected and this person not be afforded any respect, as his country has not given ours or others.</p>
<p>Remember MH 17!!!!!!! Is this person meeting the family whose children and Grandfather were shot down over Ukraine. I think not.</p>
<p>He should not be given any time in this state where precious Australian children and families died in the shooting down of a passenger plane!!!!!</p>
<p>Prime Minister Teresa May stated quite clearly and reminded the world that Russia simply laughs at us whilst continuing to pursue unconscionable behaviour on many fronts. Deny, deny, deny is their response.</p>
<p>It would be more appropriate for us as multicultural brothers and sisters to voice complete displeasure at such an event to promote more Russian propaganda.</p>
<p>There are far more worthwhile events that I would rather attend and they are Australian. Supporting people of worth who respect humankind and peace and the values of this free country.</p>
<p>Australia was the country that succoured our migrant refugee families when Europe, their homelands, were being destroyed. We were lucky to grow up in peace and not fear secret police knocking on our doors and murdering our families.</p>
<p>Count the number of refugees that have come to us, to Australia, to get away from regimes such as the Russian.</p>
<p>I am not interested what Russia thinks of Australia. I think of what we Multicultural Australians think of our nation and our relationship with the free world and its citizens.</p>
<p>I respect this country and respect that I live here in peace with my refugee mother. Read my book and understand the fear that still resides in people’s who have escaped dictatorships such as the one this person has evolved from. It permeates generations. Read, learn and understand what communism is and the control it manifests.</p>
<p>Wake up Australians! We have nothing worthwhile to learn from this person. Concentrate on educating, supporting and learning how to keep such tyranny away from our lives – that should be the focus of our youth and our Educational Institutions.</p>

<p>** **<strong>AUSTRALIAN FEDERATION OF UKRAINIAN ORGANISATIONS STATEMENT OPPOSING PROPOSED _CONVERSATION  _</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>DISCUSSION</em></strong>**  WITH   AMBASSADOR OF RUSSIA  MR GRIGORY LOGVINOV IN PERTH  **</p>
<p>**
**The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) opposes the proposed conversation with Ambassador of Russia being promoted CURTIN ALUMNI - AIIA WA BRANCH  YOUNG AUSTRALIANS in INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS in Perth this Week.</p>
<p>The AFUO fully supports the above statements made the Ukrainian Association of Western Australia and Dr Lesa Melnyczuk.</p>
<p>The Ambassador of Russia in Australia  is the representative of the Russian Federation,   the representative of President Putin who has  so much to answer for  – yet we give him the opportunity to peddle  soft politics.</p>
<p>With respect to those Australian’s who were murdered by the shooting down MH 17 by the Russian military on Ukrainian soil and to their remaining families, the organisers  should seriously consider withdrawing the invitation and cancelling the event.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian community in WA has made it feelings known  to those promoting the event – They should also let the Ambassador know he is not welcome in WA.</p>
<p>Will the Ambassador finish off with a dance with a representative of the organisers – like President Putin recently did at a wedding in Austria or pose for an photo opportunity to again create a <em>shade of grey</em> out of something that is black and white ?</p>
<p>The Australian Government has made its feelings known regards to Australia-Russia relations. The former Minister  for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop outlined this in a letter to the AFUO recently. (attached)  In a meeting with Australian Government since the AFUO has been reassured this position remains unchanged.</p>
<p>The AFUO calls on the organisers of the planned <em>conversation</em> to revoke the invitation  and stand tall and firm on Australia’s position.</p>
