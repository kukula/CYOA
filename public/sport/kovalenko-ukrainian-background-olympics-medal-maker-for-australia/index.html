<p>Growing up in Dnipropetrovsk in Ukraine with his parents and a younger sister, Victor was a fulltime student on the Ukraine’s athletic team, becoming an Honorary Master of Sports after 10 years and then President.</p>
<p>Awarded a Special diploma with a gold medal from the faculty of Physical Culture of the Nikolaev State Pedagogical Institute in the Ukraine, Victor sailed both a 470 and Flying Dutchman to National championship wins, but retired in 1983 because of the boycott of the Los Angeles Games. His mission was not completed, “that’s what gave me the drive to be a good coach.”</p>
<p>Today he is one of the most respected and successful sailing coaches around, having coached 10 crews to world title wins bringing home  gold and bronze Olympic medals.</p>
<p>Of his decision to make Australia home, Victor says: “I was here for the 470 Worlds in 1991 and stayed on to help Jenni Lidgett with her 470 Olympic campaign. I love Australia. I love the people and the gold and green hills - Australia is my love affair.”</p>
<p>After coaching the 1996 470 Men’s and Women’s Ukraine crews to Olympic gold and bronze respectively, Victor, in October 1997, accepted the then Australian Yachting Federation’s offer to coach the Australian 470 crews.</p>
<p>Victor’s work with 470 crews led to extraordinary success, particularly in 2000. He told his crews: “Get your dream, trust yourself and follow your dream.” It paid off when both Australian Men’s and Women’s crews won a number of titles, culminating in a gold medal for both at the 2000 Olympic Games and a world title for the Men.</p>
<p>Following the 2000 Games Victor was named National Head Coach and AIS Sailing Program Head Coach.</p>
<p>In November 2004, being inducted into the 470 Hall of Fame made Victor inordinately proud, but his moniker, the “Medal Maker”, makes him uncomfortable. “No, I am just helping my sailors win medals – I help them find the key – they are the medal makers.”</p>
<p>The key to his coaching triumphs, he says, “is because I love people. I feel very privileged to work with such talented people. I like to help change their personalities so they can achieve their goals. I love that process – watching them evolve.”</p>
<p>And what drives this coach? “I think of life and use it as a role model. Life is like a big race – sometimes you win by skill, sometimes you are lucky to meet interesting people and learn from them. I am transferring that knowledge to my sailors.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
