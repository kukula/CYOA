</a>**IF Tony Abbott won't shirtfront Vladimir Putin, there will be an angry crowd of protesters in Brisbane on the first day of the G20 summit who will be glad to do it for him. **</p>
<p>THE Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) has organised a protest in Brisbane's King George Square on Saturday afternoon against the Russian president to speak out against Russian inaction over the MH17 investigation.</p>
<p>The protesters will also urge other G20 nations to stop appeasing Putin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Australians hold democratic values and they therefore reject Mr Putin's tyrant terrorism, be it territorial aggression against Ukraine, supporting those responsible for downing MH17 or blocking the investigation into MH17,&rdquo; AFUO president Stefan Romaniw said in a statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;G20 leaders need to stand up to Putin, not sit down with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Appeasement has not and will not work, and will only lead to Putin taking more, including a possible full-scale invasion of Ukraine in the northern spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Romaniw said the demonstration would have street theatre, including Putin-related imagery, and anti-Putin signage.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tony Abbott famously announced last month he would &ldquo;shirtfront&rdquo; Mr Putin over Russia's support for separatists who allegedly shot down Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, resulting in the deaths of 298 people including 38 Australian citizens and residents.</p>
<p>Mr Abbott, who met Putin briefly at the APEC meeting in Beijing on Tuesday, has since toned down his threat, but Russia's response to the disaster will still be a key topic when G20 leaders meet in Brisbane at the weekend.</p>
