<p><strong>MEDIA RELEASE</strong></p>
<h3 id="call-on-australian-government-to-lead-way-on-suspension-of"><strong>Call on Australian Government to lead way on suspension of</strong></h3>
<h3 id="vladimir-putin-atg20-summit-in-hangzhou-china"><strong>Vladimir Putin at G20 Summit in Hangzhou, China</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Australian Federation of Ukrainians Organisations has written to Australia’s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull calling on Australia to lead the way to suspend Russian President Vladimir Putin’s participation in the upcoming</strong> <strong>G20 Leaders’ Summit on September 4 and 5 in Hangzhou, China.</strong></p>
<p>In its letter to the Prime Minister the AFUO argued that the Russian Federation continues its occupation of sovereign Ukrainian territory in the Crimean region, where it has instituted a regime of terror against all those who oppose its illegal occupation. The indigenous Crimean Tatar People have been particularly targeted by Russian repressions.    Ukrainian nationals and religious minorities continue to face persecution in Crimea and the other occupied territories.</p>
<p>In Eastern Ukraine, Russia continues to wage a brutal war of aggression, which since 2014 has cost over 9500 lives, wounded over 20,000 people, and displaced over 1.4 million people. The Russian Federation supplied the Buk missile system that shot down Flight MH-17 in July 2014, murdering 298 people.</p>
<p>Its increased military presence on the boarder of Eastern Ukraine in recent times is now a concern for many of the neighboring countries.</p>
<p>“While Russia wages a war of aggression against Ukraine and continues to occupy sovereign Ukrainian territory, we believe it is unacceptable that world leaders meet with President Putin to discuss global economic growth and increasing trade and investment.” AFUO Chairman Stefan Romaniw said</p>
<p>“The Free World sees this aggression as an attack on our principles and values. President Putin flaunts these and has a total disregard for the international rules of engagement and cooperation.” Mr Romaniw said.</p>
<p>In 2014, the G-7 suspended its participation in the G-8 “until Russia changes course and the environment comes back to where the G-8 is able to have a meaningful discussion.  It is time for the G-20 to send a strong message to Russian President Putin that Russia’s aggression is unacceptable to the world’s leading economies. This is not an attack on the Russian people, but rather an opportunity to assist Russia’s liberal-democrats in bringing human rights and democracy to Russia.</p>
<p>“During the G20 Summit held in Brisbane in 2014 the Australian Government and the Australian people sent President Putin a strong message that his actions were unacceptable and he would not be welcome at the international table until the Russian Federation abided by international rules.” Mr Romaniw said.</p>
<p>“Australia has shown it can play a major role in international relations. It has shown that principles and values are cherished and must be protected. We would suggest that here is another opportunity to reinforce this to the international community.” Mr Romaniw said</p>
<p>A number of peak bodies via the Ukrainian World Congress (UWC) are writing to their heads of Governments calling for President Putin’s suspension from the G20.</p>
