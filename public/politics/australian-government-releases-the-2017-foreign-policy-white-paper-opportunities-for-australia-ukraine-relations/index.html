<p><strong><em>MEDIA RELEASE</em></strong></p>
<h3 id="australian-government-releases---the-2017-foreign-policy-white-paper">Australian Government releases - The 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper</h3>
<p>Opportunities for Australia-Ukraine relations</p>
<p>The Australian Government has released its 2017 Foreign Affairs White Paper, the first comprehensive review of Australia's international engagement for 14 years.</p>
<p>It delivers a framework to ensure Australia’s prosperity and security by guiding our international efforts over the next decade and beyond.</p>
<p>The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) provided a 10-page formal submission at the time of consultation in March 2017.</p>
<p>The White Paper reinforces Australia’s commitment to Ukraine in fighting Russian Aggression and the annexation of Crimea.</p>
<p><em>Extracts:</em></p>
<p><em>“Equally, Australia will work with partners to resist Russia’s conduct when it is inimical to global security. Australia remains particularly concerned by the downing of flight MH17 and Russia’s annexation of Crimea and intervention in eastern Ukraine”</em></p>
<p>_ _<em>“Refusal to act in ways consistent with international law and these norms, such as Russia’s coercive and aggressive actions in Ukraine, Syria’s use of chemical weapons, and North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs, weakens global security.”</em></p>
<p>There is also section on MH 17 and Australia’ involvement and commitment.</p>
<p>In the section on trade, there are opportunities for Australia Ukraine bilateral relations as the paper in general terms refers to the global markets and opportunities. Australia is keen to seek out worthwhile Free Trade Agreements (FTA).</p>
<p>The AFUO is committed to working with the Australian Government in strengthening Australia-Ukraine ties and delivering the outcomes of the White Paper by:</p>
<pre><code>  * _Ensuring that the rule of law, democratic principles, national and human rights are adhered to internationally _
  * _Continuing to oppose and condemn Russian aggression in Eastern Ukraine and the strengthening of sanctions against the Russian Federation _
  * _Demanding the return of Crimea to Ukraine_
  * _Building bilateral relations_
  * _Examining the potential for a Free Trade Agreements between the two countries  _
  * _Ensuring the Embassy of Australia in Kyiv remains a permanent strategic post _
  * _Increasing trade opportunities_
  * _Protecting cyber security _
  * _Examining how Australia and Ukraine can work in partnership to strengthen relations and security in the Asia Pacific region and Europe- Eastern European region _
</code></pre>
<p>“_The Paper gives the AFUO a framework within which to continue building strategic alliances and cooperation with the Australian Embassy in Kyiv, the Embassy of Ukraine Canberra, the _</p>
<p><em>Australia-Ukraine Parliamentary Friendship Group and the Ukraine -Australia Parliamentary Friendship Group. The AFUO has been and will continue to strive to be an effective conduit, the bridge, the gel in strengthening bilateral relations,”</em> Mr. Stefan Romaniw, Chairman of the AFUO said.</p>
