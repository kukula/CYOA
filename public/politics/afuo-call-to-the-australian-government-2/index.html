</a>In the early hours of November 30th 2013 baton-wielding police violently dispersed a peaceful rally in Kyiv's Independence Square.  The Kyiv Police Chief has acknowledged that the police exceeded their powers with their violent actions and may face criminal charges. </p>
<p>The demonstrators were protesting against the failure of the president and his cabinet to proceed with the signing of an Association Agreement with the European Union and the increasingly anti-democratic stance of the government.</p>
<p>The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) has issued the following statement:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/CYOA-Letterhead-2012-600pxls1.jpg"><img src="http://www.ozeukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/CYOA-Letterhead-2012-600pxls1.jpg" alt="CYOA Letterhead 2012 600pxls">

<p> In resorting to violence, the Yanukovych regime now has no legitimacy and has crossed the line into authoritarianism. Its tactics are those of a morally bankrupt and failing regime. </p>
<p>The international community has every reason to share the concerns of Amnesty International and others about the deteriorating human rights situation in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Therefore, the AFUO:</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>  * calls upon the Australian Government to join its allies in condemning violence against peaceful protestors in Ukraine and publicly reiterating support for the Ukrainian people and their national and democratic aspirations; 
  * calls upon the Australian Government and its allies to express concern about the attempts by Russia's President, Vladimir Putin, to assert dominance over Ukraine and thereby threaten international security; 
  * calls upon the Australian Government and its allies to initiate austere sanctions upon President Yanukovych and Ukrainian government officials; 
  * calls upon the Ukrainian Australian community and Ukrainian Australian organisations to contact their elected officials and ask them to support the above initiatives, and to continue to support the Ukrainian nation through civic activism.

<p>The United States Embassy in Ukraine has condemned the forceful breaking up of the rally in the Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) in Kyiv.  In a statement published on its website, says.
&ldquo;We urge the government of Ukraine to respect the rights of civil society and the principles of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, which are fundamental to democratic values and the cornerstone of our strategic partnership.” …  &ldquo;We urge the Government of Ukraine to create a positive environment for civil society and freedom of expression among citizens of Ukraine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ambassadors of Poland, Canada, Lithuania and the European Union have visited the ongoing rally and expressed their support.</p>
