<p><strong>MEDIA RELEASE</strong></p>
<p>30 May 2017</p>
<h3 id="afuo-welcomes-the-announcement-of-the-newly-appointed-ambassador-of-australia-to-ukraine">AFUO WELCOMES THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE NEWLY APPOINTED AMBASSADOR OF AUSTRALIA TO UKRAINE</h3>
<p>The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) welcomes today’s announcement by Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop of the appointment of Ms Melissa O'Rourke as Australia's next Ambassador to Ukraine.</p>
<p>“The AFUO congratulates Ambassador O’Rourke on her appointment and looks forward to continuing the strong working relationship with the Embassy of Ukraine in Kyiv under her leadership,” AFUO Chairman Stefan Romaniw said today.</p>
<p>“Our challenge is now to work in partnership over the next two years to ensure that all the key performance indicators are met to guarantee the Kyiv post remains a permanent mission,” Mr. Romaniw said.</p>
<p>The AFUO has worked hard and in partnership with DFAT and the Embassy of Ukraine in Canberra to ensure the Embassy in Kyiv remained open.</p>
<p>“Ukraine is strategically placed in Eastern Europe. Australia can only benefit geopolitically by having a permanent mission in Kyiv. Australia’s presence in Ukraine is also very much needed,” Mr. Romaniw said.</p>
<p>The AFUO organised a range of events attended by Ukrainian Government representative’s, religious and civic leaders, NGO’s and business leaders in Ukraine for the former Ambassador Doug Trappett followed by Charge D’ Affairs Bruce Edwards to assist them with the networking process in Ukraine and introducing them to a wide circle of contacts.</p>
<p>The AFUO looks forward to doing the same for Ambassador O’Rourke after she takes up her appointment in September 2017.</p>
<p>“Australia is a steadfast supporter of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. We cooperate closely on issues relating to the investigation of the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17,” Minister Bishop said today.</p>
<p>Ms. O'Rourke is a career officer with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and has held a range of positions in DFAT including Director, United Nations and Commonwealth Section. She was most recently Deputy Head of Mission at the Australian Embassy, Moscow. She has also served overseas in Brussels and Bangkok.</p>
<p>She holds a Master of International Law, Australian National University; a Master of International Relations and Asian Politics, University of Queensland; a Bachelor of International Business, Queensland University of Technology; and Bachelor of Arts (Honours), University of Queensland.</p>
