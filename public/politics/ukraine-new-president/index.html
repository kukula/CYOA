    <h1>AFUO statement regarding Ukraine&#39;s election result</h1>
    
    <p><strong>_The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations sends a congratulatory message to President Elect Volodymyr Zelensky and recognises the efforts of outgoing President Poroshenko. _</strong></p>
<p>Ukraine has elected a new President - Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
<p>The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) has sent a letter of congratulations to Mr Zelensky.</p>
<p>The international community together with Ukrainian  Electoral Commission reported that the election process was both democratic and  transparent.  This is  a further indicator that Ukraine  is  a mature, sovereign and independent  State.</p>
<p>In its  congratulatory letter the AFUO stated ;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong><em>We look forward  to working with you on furthering  Ukraine and its interests, the continuation of the process of European and Euro-Atlantic integration, the defending  of the  territorial  sovereignty of Ukraine against  aggression from the  Russian Federation, the return of Ukraine’s occupied territories and the return of Ukraine’s  political prisoners who are incarcerated in Russia.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The further development of  economic, social  and educational spheres, the ongoing cooperation with Ukraine’s diplomatic missions in  enhancing the positive image of  Ukraine and the sharing of knowledge and experiences at different levels are also opportunities for ongoing cooperation.</em></strong></p>
<p>**_Australia’s Ukrainian community  has always supported these principles and is ready to continue to cooperate in  implementing  our common principles, values and plan and stand up to be counted if they are challenged&rdquo;. _**<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Outgoing President Poroshenko conceded defeat, and congratulated Volodymyr Zelensky . President Poroshenko has vowed to work together in furthering a stronger Ukraine.</p>
<p>Whilst there are mixed reactions as to the result , it is time to reflect and unite around the values and ideals Ukraine has fought for throughout wars and various Maidans . It is time to continue to work to move Ukraine forward to a free and united Ukraine heading to Europe without Russian interference -  We must continue to unite around withstanding Russian revanche.</p>
<p>The newly elected President has vowed to move in this direction and must be held to account on these issues.</p>
<p>New directions, new processes must not lose sight of the essence of what is the Ukrainian Nation the values that constitute Ukrainian Statehood .  There can be no Russian interference in Ukraine's future direction.</p>
<p>The eradication of all forms of corruption will build  a stronger civil society, it will build  confidence and trust  and ongoing support from the international community.</p>
<p>Australia &lsquo;s Ukrainian community has always upheld these principles, has been a positive contributor and worked with all who uphold the same principles . The community also stood up to be counted when these were challenged and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>The AFUO also extends its thanks to outgoing President Petro Poroshenko for his efforts over 5 years. Yes, more could have been done,  but much was achieved in difficult circumstances and this must be recognised.</p>
<p>The AFUO wishes him well in his future endeavours.</p>
<p>The election day has passed, and the sun rose the next day .</p>
<p>The time has now come to clarify directions, intentions and strategic plans.</p>
<p>The  Parliament of Ukraine and the Cabinet  of Ministers must remain strong, focus on reforms and be exemplary in  delivering  transparent and open  system of Government .</p>
<p>The AFUO encourages Australia’s Ukrainian community to take up the challenges  that lie before us in maintaining  and strengthening  our Ukrainian  identity in Australia, in being respected contributors to Australian society and stalwarts in contributing to Ukrainian Statehood.</p>
