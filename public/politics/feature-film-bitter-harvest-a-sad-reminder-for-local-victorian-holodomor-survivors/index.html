<h3 id="feature-film-bitter-harvest-a-sad-reminder-for-local-victorian-holodomor-survivors">Feature film Bitter Harvest a sad reminder for local Victorian Holodomor survivors</h3>
<p>Set in early 1930s Ukraine amidst the horrific famine-genocide referred to as the Holodomor (death by starvation), the Australian premiere of historical drama <em>Bitter Harvest</em> is a painful but important reminder of their past for the few remaining Victorian-based survivors.</p>
<p>Today 99-year-old Fedir Habelko hasn’t forgotten the atrocities he witnessed as a child. He experienced first-hand Stalin’s ruthless mission to collectivise Ukrainian farms leading to forced starvation, breaking national pride in the process.</p>
<p>The ‘five ears of corn law’ enacted in August 1932 stated that anyone, including children, caught taking even a bit of produce from a collective field could be shot or imprisoned for stealing ‘socialist property.’</p>
<p>“In Odesa they farmed wheat for the European market. It was sold in Europe at the very lowest price. And in Ukraine, people were dying of starvation.” said Mr Habelko.</p>
<p>The Holodomor is a horrifying event in Ukraine’s history made all the more tragic by the fact it remains relatively unknown – a famine whose death toll is placed between 7–10 million people.</p>
<p>Although the film conjures painful memories for Mr Habelko, he is grateful that the story is finally being told through a mainstream platform.</p>
<p>“People should know about this horror that the Kremlin hid from the world for so long. Those memories haunt me to this day.” Mr Habelko said.</p>
<p>_Bitter Harvest, _a Canadian production shot on location in Ukraine, is a poignant love story featuring Max Irons (<em>Woman in Gold</em>), Samantha Barks (<em>Les Miserables</em>) and Terence Stamp (<em>The Adventures of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert</em>).</p>
<p>The irony is not lost on Fedir Habelko, that the crux of the film’s story is as relevant today as it was almost 85 years ago, as the fight for a free Ukraine continues.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bitter Harvest</em></strong>** will screen in selected cinemas from 23 February 2017**. Visit <a href="http://www.beckerfilmgroup.com/bitterharvest/">beckerfilmgroup.com</a> for details.</p>
<p>The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) produced a short film of interviews with Australian Holodomor survivors for the 80 year commemoration in 2013:</p>
