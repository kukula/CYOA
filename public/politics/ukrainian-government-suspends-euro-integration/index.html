</a>On 21 November 2013, after years of negotiations, the government of Ukraine suddenly abandoned progress on the Association Agreement with the European Union. This decision was made only six days before the anticipated signing of the agreement at the November 28-29 Euro-summit in Vilnius, Lithuania.</p>
<p>The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) strongly condemns this abrupt about-face and has issued the following statement.</p>

<p><strong>MEDIA RELEASE</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>PRESIDENT YANUKOVYCH NOT TAKING UKRAINE TO EUROPE -
ANOTHER NATIONAL SELLOUT</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decision by President Yanukovych not to proceed with Ukraine’s integration into the European Union sets back the aspirations of Ukraine’s people, according the peak body for the Ukrainian Australian community.</p>
<p>Mr Stefan Romaniw OAM, Chairman of the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations who is currently in Kyiv and available for comment, is hosting an Australian MP, Marie Ficarra Parliamentary Secretary to the Premier of NSW, Barry O'Farrell on the occasion of the commemoration of the 80th Anniversary of the Holodomor 1932-33.</p>
<p>“I will meet with Government of Ukraine officials this week and tell them that not pursuing the EU / Ukraine Association Agreement denies the people of Ukraine what they deserve: a country with democratic institutions, the rule of law and economic opportunity.&rdquo; Mr Romaniw said</p>
<p>“President Yanukovych had the opportunity to make history and bring Ukraine into Europe. Instead, he has de facto approved the current situation in Ukraine of denial of human and cultural rights, and endemic corruption.</p>
<p>“President Yanukovych’s preservation of the status quo is despite the urging of the European Union, and the governments of the United States, Canada and Australia, and that of the citizens who are right now gathering on Independence Square in Kyiv.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just come from Independence Square where there a ground swell of citizens calling for Ukraine to go to Europe and condemning the Government's decision&rdquo; Mr Romaniw said</p>
<p>“Following my meetings with Ukrainian officials, the AFUO will provide an update to the Australian Government. There is now heightened need for countries like Australia who support and benefit from democratic values to support the conduct of free and fair Presidential elections in 2015 so that the Ukrainian people have their say on President Yanukovych’s actions.&rdquo; Mr Romaniw said</p>
<p>“This should take the form of increased Australian diplomatic effort, direct representation in Kyiv in readiness for its future transition, and support for independent election monitoring.&rdquo; Mr Romaniw said</p>
<p>“President Yanukovych has not listened to his own people or his growing trade partners. Those leaders who do not listen inevitably fail, and the AFUO calls on him to establish a timeline for renewing the EU / Ukraine Association Agreement process before the 2015 Presidential elections,” Mr Romaniw said.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
