  * That Ukraine has resettled over 1.8million refugees with its own borders due to Russian aggression
  * That the World Bank indicators show economic growth in Ukraine 2.3% increase in GDP and a predicted 3.5% in 2018
  * Support for Health Reforms being advocated by acting Minister for Health Ulyana Suprun

<p>Mr Romaniw also pointed to the support and cooperation of the AFUO with the Australian Embassy in Kyiv since its opening by funding cultural programs, co-sponsoring the 25 anniversary of Diplomacy program and Go Global projects amongst others.</p>
<p>The AFUO was also proactive in lobbying the Australian Government to ensure the post remained opened after September 2016 – the result an extension of two years.</p>
<p>Mr Romaniw outlined that the AFUO and Embassy of Australia have great opportunities to work in partnership in ensuring the Embassy in Kyiv becomes a permanent Mission The AFUO will host an event in Kyiv later this year to introduce the Ambassador to political and civic leadership as it has done with previous Ambassador and Charges D Affairs.</p>
<p>The Ambassador designate indicated her willingness to work with the AFUO in promoting stronger ties between the two countries.</p>
<p>Mr Romaniw also stated that it is important for Australia to continue supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression – “The bigger the footprint in Ukraine the more dangerous it is for the international community” Mr Romaniw said.</p>
<p>“The war of values and principles being fought is critical and the active demolition of adherence to these values by Putin is a huge danger and threat to the international community and world peace.”</p>
<p>Mr Romaniw quoted Republican Congressman Roger Wicker who said in Washington recently <em>“Putin must not be allowed to win this one and he won’t.”</em></p>
