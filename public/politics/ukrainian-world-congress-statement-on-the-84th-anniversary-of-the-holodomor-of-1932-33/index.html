<p>20 November 2017</p>
<p>**Ukrainian World Congress statement on the **<strong>84th anniversary of the Holodomor of 1932-33</strong></p>
<p>On Saturday, 25 November 2017, the international community will unite with Ukrainians worldwide in remembrance of the victims of the 1932-33 Holodomor, the famine-genocide that left a nation scarred but not defeated in its determination to live in dignity and freedom. As we mark the 84th anniversary of this genocide, we also begin a year-long commemoration leading to the 85th anniversary of the Holodomor that will culminate in November, 2018.</p>
<p>In describing the horrors of the Holodomor in her recently published Red Famine: Stalin’s War on Ukraine, Anne Applebaum describes the brigades who came house to house to search for and confiscate food from the starving: “With each passing day, demands became angrier, the language ruder: Why haven’t you disappeared yet? Why haven’t you dropped dead yet? <em>Why are you alive at all?”</em></p>
<p>Despite the decades-long efforts by communist authorities to eradicate the Ukrainian people, and attempts by other contemporary forces to to disinform and erase from human memory the crimes of the Holodomor, today the truth of the Holodomor is well documented, and with continued education and discussion will contribute to a better understanding of both the past and the present.</p>
<p>Ukrainians remain united in the fight against the hybrid war of the Russian Federation which continues to undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty and discredit the nation in the eyes of the world. It is the obligation of every individual living in the free world to heed the lessons of the Holodomor not only in support of the Ukrainian people, but in defence of the principles of truth, democracy and fundamental human rights.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian World Congress (UWC) and the 20-million strong Ukrainian diaspora call upon the international community to strengthen its efforts to further raise international awareness of the Holodomor and promote the recognition of the Holodomor as an act of genocide by all governments and the United Nations.</p>
<p>The UWC also appeals to all descendants of victims of the Holodomor to become the voice of family members who can no longer speak for themselves. They need you to light the candle of remembrance and share the story that will both strengthen a nation and enlighten the world.</p>
<p>Throughout 2018 the UWC, together with its member organizations, will be launching a series of initiatives to amplify the message and brighten the beacon of hope for all peoples who remain oppressed and constantly vigilant of the fragility of freedom.</p>
<p>On Saturday, 25 November 2017, International Holodomor Memorial Day, let us remember every child, woman and man that senselessly perished during this genocide.</p>
<pre><code>  * Pause for a moment of silence at 19:32 local time.
  * Light a candle of remembrance in your home.


  * Participate in commemorative events and memorial services in your local community.
</code></pre>
<p><strong><em>May our memory of the victims of the Holodomor remain eternal.</em></strong></p>
