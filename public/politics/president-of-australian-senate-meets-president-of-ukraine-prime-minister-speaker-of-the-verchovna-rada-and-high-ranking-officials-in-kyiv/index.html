<p>PRIME MINISTER, SPEAKER OF THE VERCHOVNA RADA AND HIGH-RANKING OFFICIALS IN KYIV</p>
<p>Australian-Ukrainian relations continue to strengthen with official meetings this week on Monday October 2, 2017 in Kyiv between The President of Australian Senate Senator Stephen Parry and The President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko, Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman, Speaker of the Parliament Andrij Parubij, Minister for Interior Affairs Minister Avakov and other high ranking Ukrainian Government officials.</p>
<p>Building on the recent reactivation of the Australia-Ukraine Parliamentary Friendship Group (AUPFG)headed by Chris Crewther and Senator Catryna Bilyk, this week’s meetings reinforced the strong ties between Australia and Ukraine. The Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop officially launched the (AUFPG) in Canberra on September 13, 2017 at an event hosted by the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO).</p>
<p>President Poroshenko in his meeting with Senator Parry <em>noted Australia’s unwavering support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and condemnation of the Russian aggression against Ukraine. In this context, the President thanked Australia for the continuation of sanctions against the aggressor and support in the issues related to the human rights protection in the occupied Crimea.</em></p>
<p><em>The parties noted the efficiency of the joint investigation team for the MH17 tragedy and emphasized the inevitability of punishment for all those involved in this tragedy.</em></p>
<p>Prime Minister Groysman commented – <em>“In reference to geography we are far away, but at this specific historical period we can deepen our partnership. I wish to assert our striving to enhance our diplomatic and political ties, as well as to intensify our economic cooperation,” I believe we should seek mechanisms to collaborate in the economic sphere, as nowadays we have greater potential in bilateral trade than we demonstrate.__&quot;</em></p>
<p>Speaker Andrij Parubij <em>highlighted the importance of strengthening partnerships between the Ukrainian and Australian Parliaments and offered his support for this to occur. He called on the Australian Parliament to recognise the 85 anniversary of the Holodomor and pass a resolution condemning it as an act of genocide.</em></p>
<p>The issue of the Invictus Games in Sydney in 2018 was also discussed.</p>
<p>Stephen Parry commended the efforts of the Government of Ukraine on the path of reforms. _&ldquo;Your course towards energy efficiency and the development of alternative and hydropower industry sparked our interest. We are always glad to cooperate and express readiness to explore new opportunities for trade partnership. We will prolong work with Ukraine, and our discussions can be productive,&rdquo; _</p>
<p><em>“This visit his laid the foundation for more strategic alliances and economic possibilities between Australia and Ukraine It should also commence the planning of an official visit to Ukraine by Prime Minister Turnbull. The AFUO calls on the PM to continue the momentum and visit Ukraine “AFUO</em> Chairman Stefan Romaniw said</p>
<p><em>“The visit also reinforces the message that Australia stands with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in fighting Russian aggression in Eastern Ukraine and in condemning the annexation of Crimea”</em> Mr Romaniw said.</p>
<p><em>“Having our new Ambassador designate Melissa O’Rourke in Kyiv on the back of this visit, there are great opportunists ahead -The train is moving”</em> Mr Romaniw said</p>
<p>AFUO Chairman Mr Romaniw will travel to Kyiv next week to host a Meet and Greet Australia-Ukraine event hosted by the AFUO to outline the AFUO’s strategic plans for Australia-Ukraine relations. It will also be a welcoming event to Kyiv for the new Ambassador designate Melissa O’Rourke,</p>
<p>“The AFUO is pleased to be a bridge in much of what is happening in the strengthening of Australia-Ukraine relation.“</p>
<p>_“Our work with both Embassies, Ministries and NGO’s in supporting Ukraine in its time of need through various programs in the health, education, economic and other areas, combatting Russian propaganda and the furthering of the relations between the two Parliaments will no doubt bring long term results and outcomes for both countries,“ _Mr Romaniw said.</p>
