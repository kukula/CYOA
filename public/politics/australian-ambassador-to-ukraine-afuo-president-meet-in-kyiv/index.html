<p>AUSTRALIAN AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE &amp; AFUO PRESIDENT MEET IN KYIV TO DISCUSS EUROMAIDAN ISSUES</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s Ambassador with responsibility for Ukraine, Her Excellency Jean Dunn, today arrived in Kyiv and met with the President of the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO), Mr Stefan Romaniw OAM.</p>
<p>The Ambassador, who is based in the Australian Embassy in Warsaw, will also be meeting with fellow diplomatic representatives in Ukraine tomorrow to obtain a better understanding of the situation. Edward Mortimer Second Secretary of the Embassy also participated in the meeting.</p>
<p>At their meeting, Mr Romaniw provided the Ambassador with his eyewitness account of events since the 21 November when the first Euromaidan was formed in response to the Yanukovych Government&rsquo;s decision to postpone talks on signing the accord to enter the European Union.</p>
<p>The situation was aggravated by the thuggery and beating of students by Berkut on the night of 29-30 November. The Euromaidan has also grown in stature in response to  the possibility of President Yanukovych signing an accord with the Russian Federation on Tuesday 17 December.</p>
<p>Mr Romaniw also provided background on the Euromaidan organising committee and his meetings with the Opposition and community based representatives.  He also informed the Ambassador of his visit to the &lsquo;Anti Maidan&rsquo; organised by the Party of Regions and the conversations he had with members of this opposing Maidan and their promotion of a pro-Putin position.</p>
<p>Mr Romaniw extended thanks to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Julie Bishop MP, for issuing a statement in support of Ukraine’s right for self-determination in moving towards Europe and condemning the violence exercised by the Berkut.</p>
<p>Mr Romaniw called on the Australian Government to join with its allies in considering sanctions against the Presidential regime to include:</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>  * ·        Making the President a _persona non grata_ until all issues are resolved;
  * ·        Undertaking a forensic audit of funds invested in Australia by senior Government officials, their family trusts, and their oligarch allies;
  * ·        Freezing any assets held in Australia, by senior Government officials, their family trusts, and by oligarchs who financially cooperate with the Presidential regime.
</code></pre>
<p>Issues of representation in Ukraine, trade and exchanges were also discussed.</p>
<p>According to Mr Romaniw, Ambassador Dunn showed strong commitment to ensuring the Australian Government receives firsthand advice on not only the Euromaidan, but other issues relating to Australian Ukraine affairs</p>
<p>The AFUO wishes her well in her role as the Australian representative in the region and with responsibility for Ukraine.</p>
