<h3 id="meetings-in-canberra">Meetings in Canberra</h3>
<p>The Ambassador of Ukraine, Mykola Kulinich, and AFUO Chairman, Stefan Romaniw, attended a series of meetings in Canberra on Monday 8 February 2016.</p>
<p>The first was with Craig Laundy, Chair of the Australia Ukraine Parliamentary Group (AUPG), in Canberra.</p>
<p>The AFUO called on the Australian Government to continue sending strong messages of support for Ukraine and to condemn Russian aggression and the annexation of Crimea. Whilst understanding that myriad tensions currently exist around the world, Ukraine deserves the ongoing support of the international community and should not be forgotten.</p>
<p>It was resolved to introduce regular briefings and Q&amp;A sessions to the AUPG and other Members of Parliament during sitting periods to ensure MP’s were up to speed on issues relating to Ukraine. The Embassy of Ukraine and the AFUO will provide these briefings.</p>
<p>Others issues discussed included:</p>
<pre><code>  * A call for PM Turnbull to consider visiting Ukraine
  * Reinforcing support for the Embassy of Australia in Kyiv
  * The desire for meetings with Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop and Minister for Trade Andrew Robb.
</code></pre>
<p>Craig Laundy offered his support for the issues discussed and undertook to raise them with relevant Ministers and Members of Parliament. Mr Laundy has shown strong support for AFUO initiatives in the past and continues to drive the Australia-Ukraine agenda.</p>
<p>The AFUO Chairman held further meetings with senior Members of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), Kevin McGee, Assistant Secretary Europe Division and his staff, and with Deputy Secretary DFAT Gary Quinlan former Australian Ambassador to the UN and President of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>Mr Quinlan played a key role in obtaining international support for Ukraine in the matters of the MH17 disaster, Russian aggression in Eastern Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea.</p>
<p>During these meetings Mr Romaniw raised the following points:</p>
<pre><code>  * Reinforced AFUO’s unequivocal support for the Australian Embassy in Kyiv and called on the Australian Government to continue its support
  * Proposed to hold an AFUO meet and greet function for Ambassador Doug Trappett in Kyiv to promote the Australian Embassy and build Government and business networks
  * Requested that DFAT consider rewording its travel advice for Ukraine as although tension continues in the East, the current wording dissuades travel to peaceful parts of country
  * Suggested that Australia consider how the two countries cooperate on using Ukraine’s role as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council
  * Announced that the Australia–Ukraine Chamber of Commerce is now operational
  * Voiced that the AUCC and AFUO are planning an Australia–Ukraine business forum in Kyiv later 2016 (Kateryna Kharovska, Jaroslav Duma, AUCC Deputy President Petro Matiaszek and AUCC advisor Gennadiy Kravets met in Kyiv recently to discuss the forum)
  * Announced that the Australia–Ukraine Parliamentary Group has agreed to a briefing session by the Embassy of Ukraine and AFUO for interested Members of Parliament, which will happen a minimum of three times per year.
</code></pre>
<p>In summary, AFUO reiterated its call on the Australian Government to restate its support for Ukraine and thanked them for the strong and open working relationship with DFAT.</p>
<h3 id="state-visits-by-ambassador-of-ukraine-mykola-kulinich">State visits by Ambassador of Ukraine, Mykola Kulinich</h3>
<p>AFUO and Ambassador Kulinich have agreed on a national tour to all states across Australia. The AFUO has written to state hromadas to establish suitable times for each visit.</p>
<p>The aim of the tour is to meet with:</p>
<pre><code>  * Ukrainian communities
  * State Government leadership
  * Business leaders and media
</code></pre>
<p>We call on our communities to support these initiatives.</p>
<p>The AFUO has also initiated discussions to conduct a formal meet-and-greet for the Ambassador in Canberra to establish strong networks.</p>
<h3 id="afuo-to-bestow-freedom-awards">AFUO to bestow Freedom Awards</h3>
<p>** **The AFUO is planning to hold a special event in Canberra to present the AFUO Freedom Award to the following recipients for their support of Ukraine:</p>
<pre><code>  * The Hon Julie Bishop, Minster for Foreign Affairs and Trade
  * Angus Houston, Former Chief of Defence Forces
  * Gary Quinlan, Former President of UN Security Council
</code></pre>
<p>They have highlighted the importance of an international value system, which drives sovereignty, independence and decency.</p>
<p>President Putin and his leadership have not only challenged all three but have broken all international rules. The above recipients have been at the forefront of delivering this strong message to Putin.** **</p>
<h3 id="congratulations-to-philip-ruddock-on-stellar-career-in-politics">Congratulations to Philip Ruddock on stellar career in politics</h3>
<p>After a 42-year political career, Philip Ruddock will retire to become Australia&rsquo;s first special envoy for human rights.</p>
<p>The former immigration minister and Attorney General made his announcement on Monday 8 February 2016.</p>
<p>Australia’s Ukrainian community will lose a true friend and committed ally on issues of national and human rights.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Mr Ruddock supported Ukraine through to its independence, highlighting the human and national rights violations under the Soviet and communist regime. He stood up for political prisoners, prisoners of conscience.</p>
<p>He was a strong adviser and mentor to the AFUO over many years on how to take Ukraine’s perils and oppression to the broader Australian and international communities.</p>
<p>Mr Ruddock was also strong supporter of moving resolutions on the Holodomor.</p>
<p>As Minster for Immigration at the time of the Kosovo conflict, Mr Ruddock was sympathetic to the Ukrainian community in the former Yugoslavia. He was open and receptive to the AFUO proposal of allowing some of those affected by war to migrate to Australia. His door was always open to the AFUO for which many of its administrators are grateful.</p>
<p>The AFUO has written to Mr Ruddock to thank him for his efforts and wished him well in the future.</p>
<p>A transcript of the letter is as follows.</p>
<p><em>You were a beacon for compassion and understanding of Ukraine’s situation in its time of need. You took many of your parliamentary colleagues on the journey of understanding Ukraine’s plight, suffering, persecution and history.</em></p>
<p>_You stood, and continue to stand, for human and national rights. _</p>
<p><em>In its time of need, Ukraine and the Australian-Ukrainian community knew it had a friend in Philip Ruddock.</em></p>
<p><em>Your unequivocal support for Ukraine’s independence and its further development are well documented. Your understanding of the perils and trauma of the Ukrainian community involved in the Kosovo War saw a migration of Ukrainians into Australia, all thanks to you.</em></p>
<p><em>Your openness to the AFUO over many years has afforded some of its members the privilege of your mentorship.</em></p>
<p><em>You have without a doubt left a legacy and mark on many in the community. We applaud and thank you for your sincerity.</em></p>
<p>The AFUO is planning a community event in Sydney to pay tribute to Mr Ruddock and thank him for his efforts.</p>
<p><strong>AFUO Congratulates Craig Laundy MP- New Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs.</strong></p>
<p>The AFUO sent a congratulatory note to Craig Laundy new appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs in PM Malcolm Turnbull’s new leadership team.</p>
<p>Craig is Chair of the Australia Ukraine Parliamentary. The AFUO wishes him well in his new role.</p>
<h3 id="afuo-planning-day">AFUO Planning day</h3>
<p>The AFUO executive members and committees held a half-day planning session on Sunday 14 February to develop its Mission and Vision for the next period and set an action plan.</p>
<p>The AFUO contracted the services of professional facilitator Max Dumais to lead the discussion.</p>
<p>Issues of identity, communication, community development and engagement, the changing face of the community and its needs, funding, youth welfare, public relations and Government relations were on the agenda.</p>
<p>Ukraine, the war efforts and our contribution to building image and economic development for Ukraine were also discussed.</p>
<p>The AFUO will be embarking on a national consultation program to connect with all facets of our community.</p>
<p>You are invited to send your ideas, concerns and proposals.</p>
