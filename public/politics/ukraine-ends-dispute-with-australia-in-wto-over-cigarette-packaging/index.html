<p><strong>MEDIA RELEASE</strong></p>
<p>UKRAINE ENDS DISPUTE WITH AUSTRALIA IN WTO</p>
<p>OVER CIGARETTE PACKAGING</p>
<p>ANOTHER WISE STEP IN BRINGING UKRAINE AND AUSTRALIA CLOSER</p>
<p>Ukraine has decided to end its participation in the dispute with Australia under the World Trade Organization, dealing with plain cigarette packaging.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s Minister for Economic Development and Trade, Aivaras Abromavicius announced the decision at a press conference in Kyiv on Thursday June 4, 2015.</p>
<p>Earlier, Prime Minister Yatsenyuk expressed doubts about the appropriateness of this trade dispute and instructed the Ministry to resolve the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are number reasons for our decision - First, Ukraine has limited resources and we will use these for direct trade interest in Ukraine. Secondly, there is no economic logic for this case; thirdly, the dispute has negative consequences for our country&rdquo;, Minister Abromavicius said</p>
<p>The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) made direct representation to Ukrainian Government officials in mid 2014 calling for Ukraine to drop the case. Further representation by the AFUO was made to President Poroshenko and Minister for Foreign Affairs Pavlo Klimkin in December 2014 during their visit to Australia . The AFUO also raised the issues in Ukraine at meetings with the Prime Minister, Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Parliament Hanna Hopko, Chair of the Ukraine –Australia Parliamentary Friendship Group Olena Masorina, and through the media in Ukraine.</p>
<p>These groups actively became involved and kept the matter on the Government’s agenda</p>
<p>The AFUO was in regular dialogue with the Australian Government over this period with the then Ambassador Jean Dunn and Australia’s first ambassador to Kyiv Doug Trappett who has recently held meetings with senior Ukrainian Government officials.</p>
<p>“We welcome the decision to this pointless dispute. By ending the dispute the bridges between Ukraine and Australia will be strengthened” AFUO Chairman Stefan Romaniw said</p>
<p>“Australia is actively assisting Ukraine at this time and there is much goodwill between the two countries. The AFUO congratulates the Government of Ukraine for its decision and recognising that this decision will only further improve constructive relations with Australia, “ Mr Romaniw said</p>
<p>“The AFUO’s next steps in strengthening relations will be - To continue to call on Ukraine to relax visa conditions for travel between Australia and Ukraine, Conduct bilateral business forums in Kyiv and Australia and support Ukraine in its current struggle with Russian aggression” Mr Romaniw said</p>
<p>“We welcome the Australian Government’s support through Humanitarian aid and by offering scholarships through the Endeavour Scholarship Project . We welcome the decision by Australia’s Minister for Defence Kevin Andrews by offering support to the Ukraine Armed Forces through a Defence Cooperation Program aimed at long term capacity building. Under the program Australia has offered the Ukraine Armed Forces training in Australia in support of defence force capacity.” Mr Romaniw said</p>
<p>“Having an Embassy with an Ambassador in Kyiv has been a master stroke in improving relations” Mr Romaniw said</p>
<p>Mr Romaniw will travel to Kyiv next week to continue discussions with Government officials and other organisations in a bid to continue looking at ways of strengthening bilateral relations.</p>
