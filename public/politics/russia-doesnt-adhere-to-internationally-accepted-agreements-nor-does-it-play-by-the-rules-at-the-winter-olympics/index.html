<p><strong><em>MEDIA RELEASE</em></strong></p>
<h3 id="russia-doesnt-adhere-to-internationally-accepted-agreements">RUSSIA DOESN’T ADHERE TO INTERNATIONALLY ACCEPTED AGREEMENTS</h3>
<p>NOR DOES IT PLAY BY THE RULES AT THE WINTER OLYMPICS
RULES ARE NOT FOR US – WHETHER IN MILITARY ATTACKS OR SPORTING EVENTS</p>
<p>Putin’s Russian Federation’s aggression in Eastern Ukraine continues. It illegally, annexed Crimea, it sniggers and totally disrespects international accords – Minsk and others. _These rules are not for us.  _</p>
<p>But this disrespect for the international community doesn’t end with military actions. It has now transgressed into the Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>After defeating Germany in Ice Hockey, the Russian team defied a ban by singing the Russian national anthem during the medal ceremony.</p>
<p>The Russians, were competing as <strong><em>neutral athletes.</em></strong> Singing the Russian anthem on the field of play is a violation of the IOC's rules on neutrality, which were imposed on Russia as part of sanctions punishing the nation over systematic doping across many sports.</p>
<p>This was premediated. The team's assistant captain Ilya Kovalchuk said the players had discussed beforehand whether to sing the anthem if they were to win, and they agreed they would.</p>
<p>This again shows the height of arrogance and disrespect for international rules.</p>
<p>“_The IOC allows Russian teams to compete as neutrals, to allow sportsmen to compete at the highest level – and in return the International community gets an ‘up yours’ response - We do as we please,” _Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations chairman said today.</p>
<p>Now the 2018 FIFA World Cup is scheduled to take place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018.</p>
<p>Again, the International sporting community has been lax by awarding Russia the games at a time when the international community is imposing sanctions against Putin and his administration for their aggression in Ukraine and refusing to meet agreed up terms to end the aggression.</p>
<p><em>“When will leaders in sporting and other fields realize that they too have a responsibility for taking a strong and uncategorical message to Putin. We will not tolerate you not being a team player – We want you off the pitch,”</em> Mr Romaniw said.</p>
<p>“_The AFUO understand teams play to compete at the highest-level __teams such as in the World Cup. However, Governments and sponsors should seriously consider whether to attend or support,” _Mr Romaniw said.</p>
<p>“<em>And if they decide to go they have a very real opportunity to send Putin a strong message – We oppose your aggression, we oppose your arrogance towards the international community, we condemn the disrespect being shown. We showed you a cold should in Australia at the G20. We leaders are resolute in our position until you stop the aggression in Ukraine and learn to play the rules</em>,” Mr Romaniw said.</p>
