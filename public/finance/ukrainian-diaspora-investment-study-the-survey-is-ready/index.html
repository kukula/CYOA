    <h1>Ukrainian Diaspora Investment Study - The Survey is Ready!</h1>
    
    <p>Thank you for your continued support of the US Agency for International Development’s Ukrainian Diaspora Investment Study.  <strong><em>The survey is ready!</em></strong>  Please show your love for Ukraine this week by taking and distributing the survey <strong>FAR AND WIDE</strong> throughout the Ukrainian diaspora community and encourage people to take the survey before March 7, 2016.</p>
<p>Please forward this email text to your network and feel free to cut and paste content onto social media. Please also connect to @lieslriddle on Twitter and Liesl Riddle on LinkedIn and retweet/repost announcements related to the study that you find there.  Note we are using the #FORUKRAINESURVEY in our posts.</p>
<p><strong>WHO IS CONDUCTING THIS SURVEY &amp; WHY?</strong></p>
<p>USAID is seeking answers to the following questions: What if a private Ukrainian Diaspora Fund was created to invest capital for economic development in Ukraine?  Do you think this is a good idea?  A bad idea?  Why or why not?</p>
<p><strong>WHO SHOULD TAKE THE SURVEY?</strong></p>
<p>Anyone of Ukrainian descent should take the survey.  This includes individuals who were born in Ukraine – but it also means people born outside of Ukraine whose parents, grandparents, or great-grandparents were born in Ukraine.  Everyone’s opinion matters – whether they think that a Ukrainian Diaspora Fund is a good idea or not.</p>
<p><strong>WHY SHOULD THEY TAKE THE SURVEY?</strong></p>
<p>Every voice counts.  The more people that take the survey, the more reliable, useful and impactful the results will be.</p>
<p><strong>HOW CAN SOMEONE TAKE THE SURVEY?</strong></p>
<p>The survey is available through <strong><em>MARCH 7, 2016</em></strong>, and can be taken by clicking ONE of the links below (the same survey is available in three languages).</p>
