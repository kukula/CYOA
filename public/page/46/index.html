      MEDIA RELEASE
AFUO STATEMENT ON COMMUNITY RELATIONS The shooting down of MH17 should not be used to vilify any ethnic community and should rather serve to unite Australians around our multicultural values, the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) said today.
Mr Pete Shmigel, AFUO Public Affairs Director, made the following comments after monitoring social media posts on various private on-line sites:
“While there is great sorrow and anger about MH17 across the public, especially the loss of innocent Australian lives, it is important for restraint and consideration of others in the community to apply.

UKRAINAN PEAK BODY SUPPORTS PRIME MINISTER ABBOTT
&ldquo;Let me conclude with this, the bullying of small countries by big ones, the trampling of justice and decency in the pursuit of national aggrandisement and reckless indifference to human life should have no place in our world.&rdquo; – Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon. Tony Abbott MP (July 18, Canberra, Australia)
The peak body for the Ukrainian community in Australia says that the appropriate stance by Prime Minister Tony Abbott in response to MH17 is being strongly acknowledged in Ukraine and is a good model for world leaders.
