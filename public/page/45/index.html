TUESDAY, August 19, marks the 65th anniversary of the arrival of the Ukraine community in Newcastle.
On that day in 1949, a migrant vessel, the Fairsea, arrived at Lee Wharf.
The Fairsea was the first migrant ship to arrive in Newcastle after World War II and on board were 1842 passengers, most refugees or displaced people from many European countries, including the Ukraine, who came to seek a new life.

      “Club Wise Ones” monthly catch up happened on Saturday the 9th of August at 7pm at DYM.
This gathering was sprinkled with a touch of our Ukrainian Heritage
Even though the club is based on no rules, club members have chosen to theme this gathering with a “Touch of Ukraine” to celebrate our heritage in the month that
we also commemorate ‘Ukraine’s Independence “. So we invite &amp; encourage everyone to add a touch of something Ukrainian to their attire as well as bring along a Ukrainian delicacy to share.

      MEDIA RELEASE
STATEMENT ON INDIVIDUAL IN SYDNEY DAILY TELEGRAPH STORY News that an Australian citizen is potentially collaborating with Putin-backed gangs in eastern Ukraine is very concerning to the Ukrainian Australian community.
Mr Stefan Romaniw OAM, President of the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) and former Multicultural Commissioner of Victoria, said:
I am sure that the Australian Government will very seriously investigate and deal with this matter of significant concern, where an individual appears to have chosen to go overseas to undertake weapons training, actively support and potentially participate in the Putin-backed gangs who are now suspected by many of having shot down MH17.

      Last month, our Ukrainian community in Australia witnessed two unprecedented philanthropic deeds. Both were the work of the same donors, who are well known for their generosity in support of Ukrainian life in Australia. However, this time, perhaps because of the extraordinary sums involved, the donations leave a sense that something fundamental may have changed for our Ukrainian community in Australia.
On Wednesday 25 June 2014, Victor and Mimi (Maria) Rudewych announced their donation of $1.
